Individual Morality and Social Justice.
Wallace.
MWF 10-11,
159 Mulford.
An introduction to some central issues in moral and political philosophy. The course will be  structured around a discussion of objectivity, disagreement, and pluralism in the domain of value. We will begin by addressing arguments for and against the objectivity of moral  judgments, and consider their implications for the interpretation of moral discourse and moral  practice. Next we will take up a range of concrete moral issues (involving war, killing, sex, and  our obligations to those in need), and consider the distinctive normative issues they raise. We  will then look at the requirements of living a meaningful human life, and explore their relations  to morality. In the final sections of the course we will turn to issues of social and political theory, looking at the nature of a just society and at the problems of pluralism and toleration.  Texts will be taken from contemporary sources, and will be collected in a course reader.5 
Introduction to Philosophy of Science.
Skokowski.
TuTh 11-12:30,
2 LeConte.
This course provides an introduction to topics in the philosophy of science, with readings from  primary sources. We start with an introduction to the philosophy of space and time, through the  correspondence of Leibniz and Clarke. Next we examine logical positivism, confirmationism,  falsificationism, and realism and anti-realism about scientific theories and entities. We then  spend some time analyzing Kuhn’s notion of scientific revolutions, and consider a case study in  the history of science: the Copernican revolution. We come full circle and revisit the philosophy  of space and time from the standpoint of 20th century physics, including empirical and  theoretical results, and consider the new world view in the light of special relativity.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Mancosu.
MWF 9-10,
22 Warren.
The course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and  first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal  notion of a valid argument.  Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from  the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we wil introduce a deductive system (a  natural deduction system), which explicate the intuive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational  rules in a calculus. This will be done in satges, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives  such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’ and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions  such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’. In addition, we will also develop techniques to show when  a claim does not follow from the premisses of an argument. This is done by developing the  semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the  propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic.    At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues,   such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus. Textbook: J. Barwise, J.

Philosophical Methods is intended to improve students’ ability to write and read philosophy.  These abilities will be exercised through study of and writing on the issue of personal identity.  Lectures will cover both the assigned readings on personal identity and more general issues of  philosophical methodology and writing. In addition to attending the weekly lecture, students will  meet in weekly tutorials with a Graduate Student Instructor to discuss their weekly writing  assignment and the readings. The course is restricted to Philosophy majors.104 
Ethical Theories.
Vargas.
MWF 10-11,

Course will focus on major approaches to ethical theory, including consequentialism, deontology, and virtue theories, with some attention to how these accounts connect to issues in  metaethics and moral responsibility. Readings will be by both contemporary and historical  figures including Kant, Mill, Aristotle, Nietzsche, Williams, Singer, Railton, Smart, etc. 115

Theory of Knowledge.
Ginsborg.
TuTh 12:30-2,
213 Wheeler.
Theory of knowledge, or epistemology, is concerned with the nature and possibility of knowledge. In this class we will consider some of the central questions that are discussed in contemporary theory of knowledge, for example the questions of what distinguishes knowledge from true belief, what considerations can justify a claim to knowledge, and what sorts of replies can be offered to skeptical arguments against the possibility of knowledge.  We will be concerned in particular with empirical knowledge, and more specifically the kind of knowledge that we derive from the use of our senses (for example, the knowledge I have, when I see a blue cup, that there is a blue cup in front of me).  While we will begin by reading Descartes, most of the readings will be drawn from contemporary sources.Prerequisite: Philosophy 25B or its equivalent130 
Philosophy of Social Science.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
141 McCone.
What exactly is the ontology of social reality and how does it relate to physical and psychological reality?  How do explanations in the social sciences resemble and differ from explanations in the physical sciences?  What is the role of rationality in the constitution and understanding of social phenomena?  What sorts of explanations, laws and theories can we reasonably expect from the social sciences?  Why have the social sciences been unable to predict, understand and explain such phenomena as, for example, the collapse of the Soviet Empire?In this course I expect to use and to extend the theories advanced in my books Intentionality, The Construction of Social Reality, and Rationality in Action.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Searle.
TuTh 2-3:30,
131 Morgan.
The aim of this course will be to explore certain traditional problems in the philosophy of mind in terms of recent work in philosophy and cognitive science. We will be discussing such traditional problems as the mind-body problem, the nature of intentionality, and the nature of consciousness in light of recent discussions which use computer models of cognition or which try to cast doubt on our ordinary, common-sense conceptions of the mental. These views include functionalism, artificial intelligence, eliminative materialism, parallel distributed processing, and others.135 
Theory of Meaning.
Campbell.
MWF 12-1,
213 Wheeler.
We can use language in thinking and talking about the world.  What makes this possible is that the signs of language have meaning.  How is it that individual words and phrases can be used to identify particular objects?  What is the role of consciousness in making it possible for us to think about our surroundings?Ordinary physical objects, collections of atoms and molecules, do not generally have the ability to represent other objects, or to refer to them.  What is it about humans that makes it possible for us to represent our surroundings, to refer to the objects around us?  Can we make sense of the idea that non-human animals might be able to represent their surroundings, and refer to the objects around them?We will begin by looking at Frege’s classical analysis of reference to objects, and the puzzle Frege articulated about the possibility of their being different ways of referring to the same object.  We will go on to look at Kripke’s analysis of reference, and the way in which later theorists have developed his approach into a view of meaning as a biological phenomenon.  Finally, we will look at the radically different approach proposed by the later Wittgenstein, and at the response to Wittgenstein suggested by Russell’s work on consciousness as acquaintance with one’s surroundings.136

This course covers some of the most important metalogical results that are of interest to philosophers. It is divided into three parts. The first two parts are mathematical in style whereas the last part is philosophical. In the first part we will cover the basic notions of computability theory and study in detail the Turing machine approach to computability. The second part of the course will give a detailed presentation of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and related results. Finally, we will look at the philosophical relevance of these logical results to various areas of philosophy. Phil 140A is not a prerequisite for this course.161

Introduction to the central ideas of the philosophy of David Hume (1711-1776) as found in his A Treatise of Human Nature and Enquiries Concerning Human Understanding & Concerning Its Principles of Morals: perception, thought, and knowledge; belief and the idea of causal or necessary connection; skepticism, doubt, and the continued  and distinct existence of objects; personal identity; action, motivation, freedom and necessity; morality and its source in human feeling; natural and artificial virtues; origins of justice and government; the human point or value of philosophy. 178 
Kant.
Warren.
TuTh 2-3:30,
110 Wheeler.
In this course we will examine some of the major metaphysical and epistemological themes of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason.  We will be focusing particularly on Kant’s views on the following topics: a priori knowledge and how it is possible, space and time, objectivity and experience, self-knowledge, and the contrast between appearances and things in themselves.  Several short papers and a longer paper will be required.  Prerequisite: Philosophy 25BREADINGS: 
Required:  Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, tr. Guyer&Wood, (Cambridge U. P.);  Kant, Prolegomena (Cambridge U. P.);

Heidegger.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 3:30-5,
213 Wheeler.
We will read most of Heidegger’s Being & Time.  The book is both a systematization of the existential insights of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and a radicalization of Husserl’s phenomenological account of intentionality.  What results is an original interpretation of the human condition and an account of the nature and limitations of philosophical and scientific theory.  This account has important implications for all those disciplines that study human beings.Requirements: Two 7- 8 page papers, and about 30 pages of difficult reading per week.
Attendance at weekly discussion section.Prerequisites:  History of Modern Philosophy (25B) or an equivalent course is required.  It would also help to have taken, or to take concurrently, Searle’s Philosophy of Mind (132) and/or Kant (178).200

Thought is directed to the world. But is it an actual relation with the world? This seminar will explore the possibility and plausibility of a theory of direct thought. Topics we will discuss include: the sense and reference of proper names, the conceptuality of experience, overintellectualizing the intellect, and the extended mind. Among the authors we are likely to read are: Clark, McDowell, Gibson, Burge, Merleau-Ponty and Evans.This seminar is designed primarily for graduate students in the philosophy department. Other students with appropriate background will be admitted space permitting.290-3

Gottlob Frege on Concepts and Objects.
Sluga.
M 2-4,
234 Moses.
The distinction between concepts and objects is crucial to Frege’s entire work. It determines the construction of his logic, his philosophy of mathematics, and his account of meaning and truth. The examination of how Frege wields these two notions can therefore serve as an entry into his work as a whole.Frege has discussed the distinction between concepts and objects most famously in the essay “On Concept and Object” of 1892. That essay will therefore have to be at the center of our attention. But the distinction is already implicit in the construction of his logic in the Begriffsschrift  (of 1879) where it serves to explain the distinction between first- and second level functions. It is absolutely crucial in The Foundations of Arithmetic (of 1884) where Frege argues that numbers are (abstract) objects rather than concepts. What he means here is further elaborated in the essay “Function and Concept” (1891) where Frege interprets concepts as a specific kind of function, e.g., truth-functions. This thesis is, in turn, connected with the claim that the values of truth-functions, the true and the false, are again abstract (logical) objects. Frege’s assertions about the distinction between concepts and objects are often puzzling and sometimes downright paradoxical as in his claim that “the concept ‘horse’ is not a concept.” Many of these puzzles can be resolved and in doing so we come to see that Frege has made some genuine contributions to our understanding of the notions of concept and object. But we also discover real difficulties in his handling of those notions. While the thesis that value-ranges or, more narrowly speaking, classes are logical objects appears to follow directly from his conception, it is also the source of a logical contradiction from which Frege finds it difficult to extract himself. That contradiction threatens, in turn, his entire project of providing logical foundations for arithmetic.Much of what Frege says about the distinction between concepts and objects remains, nevertheless, of philosophical interest. This is evident, for instance, from Donald Davidson’s recent book on truth and predication.Readings: Michael Beaney (ed.), The Frege Reader; Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic; Donald Davidson, Truth and Predication; Class Reader with selected secondary literature.Requirements: a term paper of ca. 15 pages; if possible a class presentation. 290-5 
Autonomy of the Phenomenal.
Martin.
W 2-4,
225 Wheeler.
Most discussion of phenomenal consciousness, whether dualist or physicalist in intent, assumes that we have a grasp of what the stream of consciousness is, or what it is like, independently of our knowledge of other aspects of the world. This is evident in the discussion of the putative identity of pain with some neural process. In this seminar I want to explore some issues which throw doubt on the autonomy of the phenomenal.In particular, I’ll aim to address the following four themes:(A) The Claims of TransparencyRecently it has become popular to insist that introspection of our sense experience confirms that such experience has the ordinary public objects of perception as part of its subject matter. Such a view is presumably rejected by those who suppose that sense perception is nothing but the awareness of non-physical sense-data. Can introspection really support the former view over the latter?For this topic I want to start with some of the recent words of caution by Michael Tye, look back to GE Moore; and assess some of the recent writings of A.D. Smith.(B) The Links between Sense Perception and ImaginationI want to return to an old theme from Hume concerning the relation between impressions and ideas and the so-called ‘Copy Principle’. In effect, Hume starts with a conception of there being a difference in kind between sense experience and other experiential episodes such as remembering and imagining, and then constructing an account which denies that there is any such difference. In the analytic tradition, Hume’s stance is endorsed almost universally. I want to explore the problems with Hume’s approach, and alternatives to this.We will be looking at work by Bernard Williams, Chris Peacocke, Zeno Vendler, David Velleman.© Emotions and Feelings of EmotionPhilosophical theories of emotion have tended to focus on the opposition between identifying emotion with feelings or with judgement. Recent popular accounts have led others to suppose that emotional states are forms of perception.In contrast, I want to suggest that we should look at the idea that emotional states are not themselves part of the stream of consciousness, and that we need to mark a fundamental distinction between emotions and feelings of emotion. This leads us instead to question how one should identify and individuate the feelings of emotion.We will be looking at work by Gilbert Ryle, Richard Wollheim, Malcolm Budd, Jesse Prinz.(D) Pain, Affect and EvaluationThe paradigm example of a simple phenomenal quality in many philosophical discussions is that of feeling pain. I want to explore the idea that pain is not a simple feeling or quality, and that we can understand what pain is only in the context of its psychological and biological function without thereby eliminating the phenomenal aspect of these episodes.We will be looking at work by Nikola Grahek and Valerie Grey Hardcastle.290-6 
Liberty and Need.
Munoz-Dardé.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses.
A common, if tacit, assumption in much political philosophy is that the normative framework of philosophical questions about the political are autonomous of the more specific practical questions addressed in moral philosophy. As a consequence, political philosophers tend to focus on questions of political obligation, property, legitimacy, community and liberty independent of the grounding of these problems in a broader ethical context. Historically, this divorce of the political from the moral is eccentric – the great writers of the Enlightenment addressed political questions all as part of a broader theory of morals. In this seminar I want to return to this older tradition, and address political issues only through more fundamental ethical concerns, without assuming that such notions as political obligation have a clear understanding or a fundamental role in exploring issues.The seminar divides into three broad elements:First: Defining Problems. 
I want to raise questions about the distinctive content of political philosophy by looking at the import of the shift from comprehensive to political liberalism in the work of Rawls. This is often interpreted as a form of retreat on Rawls’s part from a more wholehearted liberalism in the face of a multicultural or relativistic challenge. An alternative reading sees the shift in Rawls as an attempt to be more exact in the commitments that a properly liberal framework should take in political debate. In contrasting these interpretations, we will be drawn back to some earlier problems and concerns within the history of political philosophy. Rousseau occupies a distinctive position within the Enlightenment tradition, not, as sometimes popularly portrayed, for offering an excuse for revolutionary zeal and offering an ostensible rationale for totalitarian impulses in the name of liberty, but because he offers us a distinctive alternative conception of contractualism and the questions that are to be posed or answered in a political theory from the dominant tradition tracing through from Hobbes and Locke to contemporary discussion. We can see Rawls’s liberalism, consistently espoused and maintained in his political liberalism, as tracing back to the Rousseauian tradition.Second: Foundational Themes. 
I want to look at some very broad questions about the nature of value and practical reason in order to address questions of how social concerns bear on us individually and provide justification for the social constraints and demands on us.What seems quite intuitive to many of us is that others can quite properly make demands on us that their needs should be met, and that we in turn can expect and demand that our needs should also be met by others. At the same time, we recognise that there are limits both to the demands we can make on others and that they can make on us. It would be unreasonable for one to make excessive demands on others, and reasonable for us to reject excessive demands of others on us. Early utilitarian thought is attractive in the emphasis it places on the idea that there are moral requirements to meet the needs of others; and historically this had a radical political influence. However, utilitarianism is widely taken to fail as a philosophical account of the political sphere because the associated consequentialist conception both of value and of practical reason fails properly to capture the limits that the demands of others can make on individuals. This raises the question whether any other approach can answer to the intuitive elements of early utilitarianism while better respecting the idea that there are limits on the demands that can be placed on an individual. One way of thinking of recent contractualist theories of ethical and political thought is that they attempt to do just that.We shall address the question whether there is a distinctively contractualist approach to these social concerns which starts out from the needs of others but seeks to respect the limits on claims of need, by looking at a series of issues. First, questions of how the sheer number of people involved in a given claim can make a difference to what one is rationally or morally required to do. Many philosophers who reject consequentialism still hold that the number of people or claims involved has a direct bearing on what one should do. Is this supposition really so obvious? We shall then look to questions about equality and the question whether equality or fairness are themselves things of intrinsic value which we are required to pursue in our lives. Intrinsic egalitarians claim that a just society should be organised to engage with and further these values. In contrast, we shall see a needs-based account can explain the political appeal of claims of equality without having to suppose the existence of such values.This still raises a question about the existence and fostering of distinctively social goods provided by social institutions which claim resources from us that otherwise could be used for meeting needs. How are we to understand how the needs of individuals are to be balanced against the fostering of such goods as universities, museums, public art.Third: Sample Problems. I want to address some specific examples of questions of general political concern within the framework we have developed. I want to raise some questions of general concern about individual liberty and communal demands on us, familiar from general political debate but under-discussed within philosophical debate. In particular:a.)  The family. Most politicians make voter capital through claiming to protect and foster families and family life. Should a just society tolerate the institution of the family? Sociological evidence indicates that historical inequalities, advantages and disadvantages are passed on through family structure. Can the institution of the family be tolerated or justified within an individualistic perspective?b.)  Sexual Politics and the Market. Most Western societies regulate market transactions involving sexual behaviour. What justifies such restriction? Is there any particular area of human behaviour which should be removed from and preserved from economic transaction? Is there a special role or understanding of self-ownership which explains the distinctive attitude towards market transactions involving one’s own body?c.)  Charities and begging. Most Western societies regulate and restrict individual begging while encouraging and providing benefits to charitable organizations. Is it preferable for societies to prefer charitable activity over central taxation?301-1

Individual Morality and Social Justice.
Rees.
MWF 10-11,
10 Evans.
The course will introduce students to a variety of topics in both normative (theoretical) and applied ethics. We will focus, in particular, on the connections between the morality of individual agents and issues of social justice. At the individual level, we will consider both how one ought to live one’s life, and what kind of person one ought to be. At the social level, we will consider the nature and requirements of social justice, as well as which means society’s may be obligated or permitted to use in achieving it. Throughout the course, we will examine and reexamine the connections between the individual and social levels. To what extent, if any, do the requirements of social justice impose moral obligations on individuals? For example, if one lives in an unjust society, is one obligated to protest the injustice? What difference does it make if an individual must risk severe penalties in order to protest effectively? On the other hand, if some individuals do not behave morally, does social justice require the community to encourage or, even, enforce better behavior? It is clear that individual morality and social justice are not independent. In what ways, and to what extent, do they depend on each other? Is it possible for to live one’s life well, and to be a good moral agent, if one lives in an unjust society? To what extent must a just society depend on the morality of its individual members?3 
Introduction to Philosophy of the Mind.
Campbell.
MWF 2-3,
120 Latimer.
In this course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world.  There are five units in the course:
Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism)
Personal Identity
Functionalism
Consciousness
Causation
The books required for the course are:
David Chalmers (ed.), Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002).
John Perry (ed.), Personal Identity (Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press 1975).What is the mind?  Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world?  And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain?   We shall begin the course by looking at these fundamental questions about the nature of the psychological.
What is a person?  Is a person merely a biological entity, and the identity of a person just the identity of a physical thing?  Do psychological states enter into the identity of the self, or can we explain the continued existence of the self in terms that do not appeal to psychological states?  And what is the importance of personal identity?  Recently some theorists have argued that we should give it much less weight than we seem to ordinarily; we will look at those arguments.
One of the most powerful ideas in contemporary philosophy of mind is functionalism, the idea that the character of a mental state is constituted by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior.  In the third unit we look at the strengths and limitations of this idea.
One limitation of functionalism is its trouble in providing an analysis of consciousness.  What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain?  Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms?  We will try to identify the aspects of conscious experience that make it difficult to explain this characteristic of the mental life in physicalist terms.
In one way or another, throughout this course we will be going over the relation of the psychological life to the physical.  Finally, we will look at how psychological states can be said to have causes and effects.  Do we in fact ordinarily take it that psychological states do have causes and effects?  And can they do so, if the whole causal story of the world can be told entirely in terms of physics?6 
Man, God and Society in Western Literature.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 3:30-5,
145 Dwinelle.
This course will compare and contrast the Greek, Medieval and Modern worlds as expressed in their greatest literature. We will follow in detail how in the West polytheism gradually became more and more monolithic until everything was understood in relation to a single God, and then how this synthesis fell apart and left our culture with a choice between nihilism or a return to polytheism.  The goal of the course is both to illustrate how to read difficult texts and to provide an understanding of the cultural paradigms that have formed and focused our shared beliefs and practices.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Shapiro.
MWF 9-10,
2060 Valley.
This course is an introduction to truth-functional and quantificational logic.  Logic is the study of good and bad arguments (pieces of reasoning).  In a deductively good argument, the conclusion follows from the assumptions: if all assumptions are true, the conclusion is guaranteed to be true as well.  The deductive goodness of an important class of arguments rests on patterns in the way these arguments use notions such as not, and, or, if, all and some.  We will represent such patterns symbolically, and give a precise account of which patterns ensure deductive goodness and which do not.   In addition, we will introduce systems of rules for constructing deductively good arguments.  Besides becoming better at formulating and evaluating deductive arguments, students will gain an understanding of central logical concepts such as validity, implication, consistency, equivalence, soundness, and completeness.Textbook: Virginia Klenk, Understanding Symbolic Logic, 4th edition (Prentice Hall, 2002).25B 
Modern Philosophy.
McCann.
TuTh 8-9:30,
145 Dwinelle.
A survey of the major philosophers of the modern period (17th and 18th centuries):  Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Kant.  The defining characteristic of philosophy in this period was the rejection of Aristotelian philosophy as developed in the Scholastic tradition and the rise of a new mathematical/mechanical philosophy of nature (the so-called Scientific Revolution, whose major figures include Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Boyle, and Newton).  We will focus on such metaphysical and epistemological issues as:  the nature of substance, causation, space and time, identity (including personal identity), the relation between mind and body, the existence, attributes, and providence of God, skepticism about the external world,  induction,  and the structure  and limits of scientific explanation.  All readings are selections from primary sources (in some cases, translations of such sources).100 
Philosophical Methods.

This course is restricted to Philosophy majors. It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy. Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills. This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the problem of personal identity. There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading. In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper.Course readings: Personal Identity, edited by John Perry, University of California Press.104

The main purpose of this course is to answer the question “How does language relate to the world?” In order to do this we will have to explore a lot of related questions, such as those concerning the nature of truth, reference, meaning, speech acts, metaphors, fiction, and pictures. We will also try to develop a general theoretical account of how human linguistic behavior is related to the rest of human behavior and to human mental states.140A 
Intermediate Logic.
Fitelson.
MWF 12-1,
110 Wheeler.
This course has two parts. Part One (first 10 weeks) will be more technical in nature. It will involve learning some of the key metalogical results for first-order logic (e.g., soundness, completeness, and compactness). The goal will be to get through Parts 1-3 of Hunter’s Metalogic textbook, which concludes with a famous metalogical paradox
called “Skolem’s Paradox”. Part Two (last 5 weeks) will be more philosophical in nature. It will involve investigating the historical impact (on 20th century analytic philosophy) of the metalogical results covered in Part One of the course. For instance, we will discuss the influence of “Skolem’s Paradox” on the philosophical development of W.V.O. Quine and Hilary Putnam.Prerequisites. PHIL 12A, and willingness to engage both in mathematical and philosophical work.Textbook. Hunter, Metalogic, UC Press 1971.

Philosophical Logic.
MacFarlane.
TuTh 12:30-2,
126 Barrows.
An introduction to the philosophy of logic and to philosophical applications of logic. In the first part of the course (“Fundamentals”) we will discuss two notions that play a central role in logical theory: truth and validity. We will pay special attention to the philosophical significance of Tarski’s formal definitions of both notions. In the second part (“Applications”) we will look at applications of logical theory to two philosophical problems: the sorites paradox (or “paradox of the heap”) and the problem of future contingents. In grappling with these problems we will learn about many-valued logics, modal operators, supervaluations, and the logic of indexicals, and we will bring to bear our earlier, more abstract discussions of truth and validity.
Prerequisites: I will not presuppose any knowledge of logic beyond what is taught in Philosophy 12A. In addition to 12A, you must have taken at least one other course in philosophy.
Requirements will include both papers and occasional problem sets.Readings: John Etchemendy, The Concept of Logical Consequence; Timothy Williamson, Vagueness; course reader.148 
Probability and Induction.
Fitelson.
MWF 3-4,
126 Barrows.
What is probability? How is probability useful for understanding inductive inference? Is there such a thing as inductive logic? If so, how does it relate to deductive logic, and what role does probability play in inductive logic? And, how is inductive logic related to inductive epistemology? These are the main (general) questions we will address in this course. Some specific topics we’ll discuss are: Hempel’s paradox of confirmation, Goodman’s “new riddle of induction”, Carnapian inductive logic, contemporary Bayesian confirmation theory and Bayesian epistemology, and various puzzles and paradoxes involving probability and evidence.Prerequisites. PHIL 12A, and willingness to engage both in mathematical and philosophical work.All readings for the course will be provided via the course website.174 
Locke.
Shapiro.
MFW 1-2,
110 Wheeler.
In this course, we will undertake a close study of Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding, with attention to philosophical and scientific context (Scholastic and Cartesian views of reality and our capacity for knowledge, Boyle’s corpuscularianism).  Among the topics to be considered: the nature of Lockean ideas, Locke’s distinction between primary and secondary qualities, his position on substance, the role of mechanism in his philosophy, his account of kinds and their essences, his view of the functioning of language, and his account of personal identity.  Throughout, we will keep in mind the Essay’s central aim of delimiting the extent of human knowledge.Reading: John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, ed. P. Nidditch (Oxford University Press, 1979), as well as selections in a course reader.186B

Phenomenology.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 11-12:30,
166 Barrows.
With growing interest in the role of the body in perception, and in the related question of the possibility and nature of non-conceptual content, Merleau-Ponty’s classic work, Phenomenology of Perception, has become increasingly relevant.  We will read Phenomenology of Perception in order to understand and evaluate Merleau-Ponty’s arguments against what he calls empiricism (a sort of behaviorism) and intellectualism (cognitivism), as well as his positive account of what he calls motor intentionality  – a kind of intentionality without conceptual content that, Merleau-Ponty argues, is the basic way human beings are embedded in the world.  290-1 
Locke’s Essay.
McCann.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses.
We have two main aims in the seminar:  first, to get a clear picture of the main elements of Locke’s mechanistic philosophy of nature (including substance, identity, primary and secondary qualities, real and nominal essences, and the nature of explanation), and second, to evaluate the anti-essentialist arguments that Locke gives against the Aristotelian/Scholastic doctrine of substantial forms both in terms of their effectiveness against their intended target and in terms of their applicability to modern-day versions of essentialism (primarily Kripke’s and Putnam’s).  As regards the former, we will track similarities and differences between Locke’s views on these issues and those of his scientific mentor, Robert Boyle.  We will also briefly consider some background issues in Locke’s epistemology (for example, the rejection of innate ideas, the general theory of ideas and the question of indirect or representative realism), but the main focus will be on topics in metaphysics and the philosophy of science. 290-2 
Metaphysics, Modality and Value.
Stroud.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses.
An investigation of the extent to which support can be found for the negative metaphysical doctrines that causation (or law-like dependence), absolute (or ‘logical’) necessity, and values are not part of a reality fully independent of us and our responses to the world.  The focus in each case will be on whether anyone who thinks and acts in the world in the ways we do could consistently understand our causal, modal, and evaluative attitudes as those metaphysical doctrines imply they are to be understood.  A further question will be the more general metaphysical significance of any such outcome.290-3 
Context Sensitivity in Semantics.
MacFarlane.
W 2-4,
234 Moses.
Words like ‘I’, ‘here’, ‘now’, ‘this’, and ‘yesterday’ are generally recognized to be context-sensitive in a way that ‘cow’, ‘table’, and ‘fifteen’ are not.  Their contribution to what is expressed by sentences containing them depends systematically on features of the context in which they are used.  In the wake of David Kaplan’s seminal work on the logic and semantics of indexicals in the 1970s, it has become popular to represent this context sensitivity formally by relativizing sentence truth to a “context of use.”Kaplan’s work was focused fairly narrowly on standard indexicals and demonstratives.  Recently, however, philosophers and semanticists have been busily extending the bounds of semantic context sensitivity to other kinds of expressions, including gradable adjectives like ‘tall’ and ‘flat’, counterfactual and indicative conditionals, epistemic modals like ‘might’ and ‘possibly’, propositional attitude verbs, and terms of epistemic assessment like ‘know’ and ‘justify’.  Accompanying the first-order discussion of these expressions (which is often motivated by philosophical as well as semantic concerns) has been considerable methodological discussion about just where to draw the line between semantic and pragmatic sources of context sensitivity.  In addition to various moderate positions that draw the line in different places, two extreme positions have been defended: conservatives have argued that semantic context sensitivity is limited to the canonical indexicals, while radicals have argued that it infects all language to such an extent that formal semantics is impossible.  In the first part of the seminar, we will try to sort out what is at stake in these debates.In the second part of the seminar, I will argue for a generalization of Kaplan’s framework, in which truth is relativized not just to a context of use but also to what I call a “context of assessment.”  I will argue that this generalization is needed in order to make good semantic and philosophical sense of epistemic modals, terms of epistemic assessment (like ‘know’), predicates of personal taste (like ‘fun’),  tense (in an indeterministic framework), indicative conditionals, and possibly other bits of language.  These expressions, I will argue, are context-sensitive, but not in the familiar way.  Instead of being “use-sensitive,” they are “assessment-sensitive.”  In addition to working out a formal framework for the description of assessment sensitivity, we will grapple head-on with the philosophical difficulties raised by assessment sensitivity and the kind of “relative truth” it requires.290-4 
The Nature of Consciousness.
Searle.

Individual Morality and Social Justice.
Rees.
MWF 2-3,
4 LeConte.
The course will introduce students to a variety of topics in both normative (theoretical) and applied ethics. We will focus, in particular, on the connexions between the morality of individual agents and issues of social justice. At the individual level, we will be consider both how one ought to live one’s life, and what kind of person one ought to be. At the social level, we will consider the nature and requirements of social justice, as well as which means society’s may be obligated or permitted to use in achieving it. Throughout the course, we will examine and reexamine the connexions between the individual and social levels. To what extent, if any, do the requirements of social justice impose moral obligations on individuals? For example, if one lives in an unjust society, is one obligated to protest the injustice? What difference does it make if an individual must risk severe penalties in order to protest effectively? On the other hand, if some individuals do not behave morally, does social justice require the community to encourage or, even, enforce better behaviour? It is clear that individual morality and social justice are not independent. In what ways, and to what extent, do they depend on each other? Is it possible for to live one’s life well, and to be a good moral agent, if one lives in an unjust society? To what extent must a just society depend on the morality of its individual members?5 
Science and Human Understanding.
Skokowski.
TuTh 11-12:30,
30 Wheeler.
This course provides an introduction to topics in the philosophy of science, with readings from primary sources. We start with an introduction to the philosophy of space and time, through the correspondence of Leibniz and Clarke. Next we examine the influential Logical Positivism movement and its progeny: confirmationism and falsificationism. We then spend some time analyzing Kuhn’s notion of scientific revolutions, and consider a case study in the history of science: the Copernican revolution. We come full circle and revisit the philosophy of space and time from the standpoint of 20th century physics, including empirical and theoretical results, and consider our new world view in the light of Einsteinian relativity.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Fitelson.
TuTh 12:30-2,
390 Hearst Mining.
Logic is about reasoning, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and how to tell the difference between good and bad reasoning.In this course, we will develop techniques for laying bare the structure of arguments (“reasonings”). This will enable us then to characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These three things – a conception of structure of arguments, a precise characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning – constitute a “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a conclusion.Textbook: Modern Logic by Graeme Forbes, Oxford University Press, 1994.24 
Freshman Seminar.

Ancient Philosophy.
MacFarlane.
MWF 10-11,
100 Lewis.
This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy–and, for the uninitiated, to philosophy itself. We will spend almost all of our time on the three most important Greek philosophers–Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle–with a passing glance at pre-Socratic and Hellenistic philosophers. Our primary goal will be to understand these philosophers’ characteristic methods and views, and (more importantly) their reasons for holding these views. It is often said that we should study ancient Greek philosophy because it is the intellectual basis for all later western philosophy and natural science. That is true, but it is only half the story. We should also study ancient Greek philosophy to become familiar with a worldview so alien that it throws our own into sharp relief. As you are outraged by some of the things these philosophers say, you will come to see more clearly what your own views are, and you will be forced to ask what justifies them. You will not just be studying the history of philosophy; you will be doing philosophy. Prerequisite: None.39K 
Freshman and Sophomore Seminar.
Rees.
Tu 2-5,
227 Cheit.
In the early seventeenth century, René Descartes proposed a radical new approach to enquiry: the Method of Doubt. This seminar will focus on Descartes’ Method: who is supposed to use it? How is the method meant to work? What did Descartes think it could achieve? Does it succeed? We will begin by reading, and critically evaluating, Descartes’ Meditations on First Philosophy and Discourse on Method. In the second part of the seminar, we will explore contemporary critiques of Descartes’ Method and its continuing influence on Western philosophy.The structure of the seminar will encourage students to develop their abilities to read critically, analyze and evaluate arguments, and engage in constructive philosophical debate. Students should be willing to read and reread the text with care, raise questions, and think independently.100

This course is restricted to Philosophy majors.  It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy.  Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills.  This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the problem of personal identity.  There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading.  In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper.Course readings:  Personal Identity, edited by John Perry, University of California Press.104 
Ethical Theories.
Rees.
MWF 10-11,
155 Kroeber.
This course is an introduction to normative ethics in the Western, analytic tradition. As we survey a variety of ethical theories proposed by ancient, modern and contemporary philosophers, we will try to trace the development moral thought, and the continuing influence of earlier approaches on current philosophical and popular ethical views.115 
Political Philosophy.
Scheffler.
MWF 10-11,
145 Dwinelle.
This course will deal with central questions about the justification of political and social institutions. The primary focus will be on contemporary philosophical thought in the liberal tradition, with special emphasis on the work of Rawls.122 
Theory of Knowledge.
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,

Some central philosophical problems about the possibility of human knowledge explored through careful reading and discussion of classical and contemporary writings.            130 
Philosophy of Social Science.
Searle.
TuTh 2-3:30,
105 North Gate.
What exactly is the ontology of social reality and how does it relate to physical and psychological reality?  How do explanations in the social sciences resemble and differ from explanations in the physical sciences?  What is the role of rationality in the constitution and understanding of social phenomena?  What sorts of explanations, laws and theories can we reasonably expect from the social sciences?  Why have the social sciences been unable to predict, understand and explain such phenomena as, for example, the collapse of the Soviet Empire?In this course I expect to use and to extend the theories advanced in my books Intentionality, The Construction of Social Reality and Rationality in Action.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
A1 Hearst.
The aim of this course will be to explore certain traditional problems in the philosophy of mind in terms of recent work in philosophy and cognitive science. We will be discussing such traditional problems as the mind-body problem, the nature of intentionality, and the nature of consciousness in light of recent discussions which use computer models of cognition or which try to cast doubt on our ordinary, common-sense conceptions of the mental. These views include functionalism, artificial intelligence, eliminative materialism, parallel distributed processing, and others.135 
Theory of Meaning.
Campbell.
TuTh 9:30-11,
126 Barrows.
This course will review central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects.  What explains our ability to refer to objects?  Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it?  And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon?  We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Fodor, and theorists who have built on their ideas.  We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein.
We will begin, though, with the accounts of reference set out by Frege and Russell.160 
Plato.
Code.
MWF 1-2,
110  Wheeler.
This course will be devoted to a close examination of some of the central themes of Plato’s metaphysics and epistemology.  The topics to be covered will include the theory of Forms, the doctrine the learning is recollection, the distinction between knowledge and belief, the nature and role of perception, and the treatment of non-being.  We will discuss the treatment of these topics in Plato’s Phaedo, Republic, Cratylus, Theaetetus, Sophist and Parmenides. Required Texts:

Thebulk of the course will be taken up with a close study of Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy, with attention to related passages in the Objections and Replies, the Principles of Philosophy, and others of Descartes’s works.  We will focus on the following issues:  skepticism and its overcoming; rationalist epistemology and foundationalism; the nature of mental representation (i.e. the theory of ideas); the real distinction between mind and body; the foundations of mathematical/mechanistic science; and the existence and providence of God.  There will be a brief survey at the beginning of the course of the relevant background to the Meditations, with short selections from St. Thomas Aquinas and Francis Suarez (the Scholastic background) and from Galileo (the scientific background).  The course will end with a brief consideration of the work of one of Descartes’s earliest and most important successors, Nicolas Malebranche, both to trace some of Descartes’s influence and to highlight the distinctiveness of his views.Course readings:

Conditionals.
Fitelson.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses.
This seminar will focus on the nature of conditionals (if-then statements).  We will try to get to the bottom of several contemporary debates about conditionals.  These debates will involve semantical, metaphysical, epistemological, logical, and pragmatic aspects of conditionals of various kinds (including indicative and subjunctive conditionals).  The course will be pretty self-contained, and it will not presuppose too much technical or philosophical background.  Our main goal will be to complete a careful reading of (most of) Jonathan Bennett’s recent book “A Philosophical Guide to Conditionals” (an excellent survey of the contemporary literature on conditionals).  We will also read some of the primary sources that Bennett discusses (these additional readings will all be made available on the seminar webpage).Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California2

Special Topics in Political Philosophy.
Scheffler.
Tu 2-5,

This course will be taught in seminar format, with one weekly three-hour meeting and enrollment limited to fifteen students.  The topic of the seminar will be global justice.  Are there principles of justice that apply to the world as a whole?  If there are no such principles, then who, if anyone, is responsible for the alleviation of global poverty?  What becomes of the idea of human rights?  And is there anything wrong with economic inequality between rich and poor nations?  If, on the other hand, there are principles of global justice, then do they supplement or instead take the place of principles that apply to a single society?  Are we ever justified in giving the interests of our compatriots priority over the interests of other people?  In the absence of a world government, who might be responsible for implementing global principles?  The course is intended for juniors and seniors with substantial background in philosophy.  Philosophy 115 or the equivalent is a prerequisite, and the course will presuppose familiarity with Rawls’ A Theory of Justice and Political Liberalism.  Course readings will be drawn from four books: Charles Beitz, Political Theory and International Relations, Thomas Pogge, World Poverty and Human Rights, John Rawls, The Law of Peoples, and Peter Singer, One World.  Students will be required to give one or more class presentations, to complete a short written assignment (1-2 pages) each week, and to write a final term paper of 12-15 pages.  Active participation in class discussion is also a requirement.Enrollment in the course is by consent of the instructor only.  Students who are interested in enrolling should contact Professor Scheffler by e-mail before 5 p.m. on Monday, December 1.  E-mails should be addressed to schefflr@socrates.berkeley.edu and should include “Philosophy 116 application” in the subject line.  Those who contact Professor Scheffler before the deadline will receive an application form with more detailed instructions.  Students will be informed by mid-December whether they are admitted to the course.  Students who are admitted to the course and who attend the first class meeting will receive a class entry code and will be able to enroll through TELEBEARS during the first week of classes.  Please note that since admission to the course is not guaranteed, students who need a philosophy course to graduate in Spring 2004 should have a backup plan for meeting that need.133

The philosophy of perception is a microcosm of the metaphysics of mind.  Its central problems – What is perception?  What is the nature of perceptual consciousness?  How can one fit an account of perceptual experience into a broader account of the nature of the mind and the world? – are problems at the heart of metaphysics.  It is often justifiably said that the theory of perception (and especially vision) is the area of psychology and neuroscience that has made the greatest progress in recent years. Despite this progress, or perhaps because of it, philosophical problems about perception retain a great urgency, both for philosophy and for science.Course readings:  Vision and Mind:  Selected Readings in the Philosophy of Perception, by Alva Noe and Evan Thompson (MIT Press), 2002.

This course covers the most important metalogical results that are of interest to philosophers. It is divided into four parts. The first three parts are mathematical in style whereas the last part is philosophical. In the first part we will cover the basic notions of computability theory and study in detail the Turing’s machine approach to computability. We will then move on to the basic metatheoretical results about first order logic (completeness, undecidability, compactness, Löwenheim-Skolem). The third part of the course will give a detailed presentation of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems. Finally, we will look at the philosophical relevance of these logical results to various areas of philosophy.Prerequisite: 12A (or equivalent) or permission from the instructor.Course readings:  Boolos, Burgess, Jeffery, Computability and Logic, 4th edition, 2002 Cambridge UP.

Probability and Induction.
Fitelson.
TuTh 2-3:30,

What is probability?  How is probability useful for understanding inductive and statistical inference?  Is there such a thing as inductive logic?  If so, how does it relate to deductive logic, and what role does probability play in inductive logic?  These are the main questions we will address in this course.  Other topics will include: foundational aspects of modern statistical methods and techniques, Hume’s problem of induction, Goodman’s “new riddle of induction”, Bayesian confirmation theory, and Bayesian statistics.Prerequisites. PHIL 12A, and willingness to engage both in mathematical (i.e., probability theory) and philosophical work.Required Texts (two of them):

Aristotle .
Hursthouse.
TuTh 9:30-11,
TBA.
Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics is regarded by many as the greatest work in moral philosophy ever written. Readers unacquainted with virtue ethics or ancient philosophy have to accustom themselves to a different mode of thought in Aristotle which challenges much in modern analytical philosophy, but when we read him on how we should live, on the role of the emotions in our moral life, on the individual virtues and vices, on friendship, on moral education, and on the primacy of the practical over the theoretical in ethics, we find his work, despite its antiquity, as relevant to contemporary thought as one could wish. These topics and others will be covered in the lectures. Students are advised to read the whole work before the beginning of semester to prepare for the class.Course readings:  Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle, Sarah Broadie and Christopher Rowe, Oxford University Press, lsted.

Heidegger’s Being and Time.

TuTh 11-12:30,

One of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century, Being and Time is both a systematization of the existential insights of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and a radicalization of Husserl’s phenomenological account of intentionality.  What results is an original interpretation of being-in-the-world that describes skill in a way that undermines the subject/object distinction, and, in so doing, offers a convincing account of the nature and limitations of philosophical and scientific theory.  This account has important implications for all those disciplines that study human beings.Required text:  Heidegger, M, Being and Time, trans Macquarrie & Robinson (Harper and Row)Recommended texts:

Freud is widely acknowledged, along with Marx and Einstein, to have been one of the primary influences on twentieth century thought. Our goal is twofold. The first is to investigate psychoanalytic theory itself, as developed by Freud, amended by some of his significant philosophers, and supplemented contemporary neuroscience. The second is to enable students in philosophy, literature, psychology, and history to use the psychoanalytic perspective in their own disciplines; our critical eye will be particularly on the questions Freud raises in the philosophy of mind, and the implications of his theory for such philosophy. While the course will roughly follow the progression of Freud’s thought, its focus is not primarily historical but thematic.Required texts:

Recent Work in Ethics.
Wallace.
M 2-4,
TBA.
In this course we will be discussing a set of influential and important writings on a variety of topics in moral philosophy from the past 30 years or so. The aim of the seminar is to provide an overview of some of the topics that have attracted the attention of contemporary moral philosophers, through close reading of texts that have helped to set the agenda for those discussions. The seminar would be appropriate both for those who have not yet done much work in value theory, and for those with more specialized interests in this part of the subject (to whom some of the readings may already be familiar). 290-2 
Topics in Social Ontology.
Searle.
Tu 2-4,
TBA.
There is a recent growth of philosophical interest in the ontology of the social.  Some of the questions in this field are:  What is a social fact?   What are the relations between individual and collective intentionality?  What are human institutions?  How does human society differ from other primate societies?  What is the role of language in constituting human society?  How do power relations enter into social relations generally?  What sorts of facts can be “socially constructed” and what sorts cannot?In this seminar we will discuss works by Habermas, Gilbert, Tuomela, Searle and others.290-3 
Truth, Logical Consequence, and Logical Constants.

Scientific Explanation and Scientific Realism.
Fitelson.
TBA,
TBA.
The first half (approximately) of this course will involve a historical and philosophical trace of 20th century thinking about scientific explanation.  We will study (inter alia) deductive-nomological, inductive-statistical, causal, counterfactual, and pragmatic approaches to scientific explanation.  In the second half (approximately) of the course, we will investigate the relationship between scientific explanation and scientific realism. Various arguments for scientific realism trade on various kinds of appeals to scientific explanation.  We will look at several of these arguments, and some replies from empiricists and other non-realists about science.  Time permitting: we will look at some alternative, non-realist (e.g., empiricist and instrumentalist) views of scientific progress and its relation to scientific explanation (as opposed to, e.g., prediction).Required Texts (two of them):

The course will consist of a very close reading and extended discussion of the Philosophical Investigations which will be conducted in the following way. Students will read a certain number of pages of the PI each week, beginning the week before lectures start, and send a one page summary to a mailing list. If (and only if) these are received by the Monday, I will write comments on them. Everyone will read each others’ summaries before we meet and be expected to contribute to discussion of the pages covered.

Individual Morality and Social Justice.
Wallace.
TBA,
TBA.
An introduction to some central issues in moral and political philosophy. The course will be structured around a discussion of objectivity, disagreement, and pluralism in the domain of value. We will begin by addressing arguments for and against the objectivity of moral judgments, and consider their implications for the interpretation of moral discourse and moral practice. Next we will take up a range of concrete moral issues (involving war, killing, sex, and our obligations to those in need), and consider the distinctive normative issues they raise. We will then look at the requirements of living a meaningful human life, and explore their relations to morality. In the final sections of the course we will turn to issues of social and political theory, looking at the nature of a just society and at the problems of pluralism and toleration.
Texts will be taken primarily from contemporary sources, and will be collected in a course reader.      5 
Science and Human Understanding.
Bacciagaluppi.
TBA,
TBA.
The philosophy of science, including also the philosophies of the special sciences (physics, biology etc.), plays a crucial role at the interface between science and philosophy (or at least it ought to!): it feeds both into science by analyzing its conceptual
foundations, and into large branches of philosophy by testing their practical applications. The course will both examine general issues and concrete examples from the philosophy of physics (no special background is required).12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Mancosu.
TBA,
TBA.
The course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument.  Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we wil introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicate the intuive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in satges, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’ and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’. In addition, we will also develop techniques to show when a claim does not follow from the premisses of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic.
    At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues,  such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus.

Ancient Philosophy.
Code.
TBA,
TBA.
An introduction to ancient philosophy primarily through major works of Plato and Aristotle. Plato and Aristotle set the agenda for many of the questions still thought fundamental to philosophic inquiry, but approached them in a spirit different from that typical of modern philosophy. They thought of philosophy as a way of life; indeed, the best way. The main topics to be covered are ethical virtue and its relation to happiness, the soul and its relation to the body, and the objects and nature of knowledge.  We will also consider the writing of Plato and Aristotle in the light of early Greek philosophers before Plato, as well as later developments by Epicureans, Stoics and Skeptics.
Readings from Plato will include Apology, Crito, Euthyphro, Protagoras Meno, Phaedo, and Republic; those from Aristotle will include selections from Categories, Posterior Analytics, Physics, Parts of Animals, Metaphysics, De Anima, Politics and Nicomachean Ethics.
Requirements: two four-page papers; final exam. All readings will be taken from:
(1) Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy: From Thales to Aristotle (2nd edition), edited by S. Marc Cohen, P. Curd and C.D.C. Reeve.
(2) Hellenistic Philosophy: Introductory Readings (2nd edition), edited and translated by Brad Inwood and Lloyd P. Gerson100 
Philosophical Methods.

The course aims to help students improve their philosophical reading and writing. Students will write or revise papers weekly, and they will meet weekly with their GSIs to discuss their work.  The instructor will hold two one-hour class meetings each week to discuss the philosophical issues (of personal identity) about which the students will be writing, and to offer general advice about reading and writing philosophy.  Readings will be drawn from the works of  Locke, Reid, Hume, and three or four contemporary philosophers.  The course is required of philosophy majors, and enrollment is restricted to students who have declared the major.109 
Freedom and Responsibility.
Wallace.
TBA,

A systematic examination of freedom and responsibility. The following topics will be addressed (among others): the relations between freedom of will, freedom of action, and autonomy; moral responsibility and its conditions; naturalism, determinism, and their relevance for human freedom; practical deliberation and the structure of the will; weakness and strength of will. Readings may be drawn from both historical and contemporary sources. The goal of the course is to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to historical and contemporary philosophical debates about the issues of freedom and responsibility.

Metaphysics is the study of the constitution of reality – of what there is and how things are – in the most general sense. This course will be a survey of contemporary metaphysics, covering realism & anti-realism, universals & particulars, propositions & facts, necessity & possibility, and time & causation.  In exploring these and related issues, we will read the work of many contemporary philosophers, including Quine, Armstrong, Lewis, Loux, Kripke, Taylor, Smart, Prior, Mellor, Putnam, Dummett, van Inwagen, and others. Prerequisite: previous coursework in philosophy or permission of instructor.146

Hume.
Broughton.
TBA,

We will study the first book of Hume’s Treatise and his 
Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, aiming to understand the claims and arguments he makes about the nature, origin, and justification of our ideas and
beliefs.  We will examine with special care the philosophical issues he
raises about causal inference, causal necessity, and our ideas of material
objects, the self, and God.  We will also address more general questions,
including these:  What are the explanatory goals and methods of a
“scientist of man”?  What lines of thought lead Hume to skeptical
conclusions?  How are Hume’s naturalism and skepticism related to one
another?178

We will explore questions about Hume’s “naturalism” in several senses of that flexible term.  These may include his anti-supernaturalism, his attitudes toward the assumption that sense perception acquaints us with bodies, the limits of his readiness to question the practice of causal inference, the explanatory character of a “science of man,” and the nature of his endorsement of inquiries into human nature.  Our main text will be Book One of the Treatise.  We will also read articles and book-chapters by Edward Craig, Louis Loeb, Don Garrett, P. F. Strawson, and others.290-5 
Leibniz.
Warren.

We will begin by spending two weeks  reading the “Monadology,” which gives an overview of Leibniz’s philosophical system.  The rest of the seminar will focus on the New Essays on Human Understanding, a work in which Leibniz presents his philosophical views on the philosophy of mind, epistemology, and metaphysics, in a detailed response to Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding.  We will be especially interested in considering the significance of this work for the conflict between empiricism and rationalism, and for the development of Kant’s thought.Required Texts:

The Nature of Mind.
Campbell.
MWF 2-3,
2060 Valley.
In this course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five units in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Personal 
Identity, Functionalism, Consciousness, and Causation. The books required for the course are: David Chalmers (ed.), Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002). John Perry (ed.), Personal Identity, (Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press 1975).What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? We shall begin the course by looking at these fundamental questions about the nature of the psychological. What is a person? Is a person merely a biological entity, and the identity of a person just the identity of a physical thing? Do psychological states enter into the identity of the self, or can we explain the continued existence of the self in terms that do not appeal to psychological states? And what is the importance of personal identity? Recently some theorists have argued that we should give it much less weight than we seem to ordinarily; we will look at those arguments. One of the most powerful ideas in contemporary philosophy of mind is functionalism, the idea that the character of a mental state is constituted by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior. In the third unit we look at the strengths and limitations of this idea. One limitation of functionalism is its trouble in providing an analysis of consciousness. What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? We will try to identify the aspects of conscious experience that make it difficult to explain this characteristic of the mental life in physicalist terms. In one way or another, throughout this course we will be going over the relation of the psychological life to the physical. Finally, we will look at how psychological states can be said to have causes and effects. Do we in fact ordinarily take it that psychological states do have causes and effects? And can they do so, if the whole causal story of the world can be told entirely in terms of physics?5

Philosophy 6:   From gods to God and back
    This course will compare and contrast the Greek, Medieval and Modern worlds as expressed in their greatest literature. We will follow in detail how in the West polytheism gradually became more and more monolithic until everything was understood in relation to a single God, and then how this synthesis fell apart and left our culture with a choice between nihilism and a return to polytheism.  The goal of the course is both to illustrate how to read difficult texts and to provide an understanding of the cultural paradigms that have formed and focused our shared beliefs and practices.
Reading: Homer, Odyssey; Aeschylus, Oresteia; Virgil Aeneid; Dante; Divine Comedy, Pascal, Pensées; Melville, Moby Dick.

Modern Philosophy.
Ginsborg.
MWF 11-12,
145 Dwinelle.
The course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics. We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.39L 
Freshman&Sophomore Seminar: Perception and Reality.
Ginsborg.
W 2-5,
108 Wheeler.
Perception and RealityOne of our main ways of finding out about the world is through perceptual experience of it: for example, through seeing, hearing and touching things.  But there is a great deal that is puzzling about what perceptual experience is, and about how (or indeed, whether) it makes knowledge possible.  Some of the puzzles are best dealt with in experimental psychology and physiology, for example by looking at how the sense-organs and brain function in perception. But some of the questions which arise about perception and its relation to knowledge are primarily philosophical, rather than psychological or physiological.  Many important philosophers, including Aristotle, Descartes and Kant, have dealt with these questions, and indeed have treated them as central in understanding the nature of reality and our knowledge of it.  Moreover, questions about perception remain central in contemporary philosophy of mind and theory of knowledge.  In this seminar we will read and discuss a number of philosophical texts dealing with perception and knowledge, some classical and some more recent.  Because the topic is a large one, we will not be trying to cover it comprehensively, but rather to study carefully a few selected texts.  While the texts will be difficult and require careful reading, the class will not presuppose any prior knowledge of philosophy; it is intended to give students an opportunity to get acquainted with philosophy in a small class with a lot of emphasis on discussion.  Students taking the course should be prepared to participate actively in class discussion. They will be required to write a short paper each week and a longer final paper at the end of the semester.Admission to the course is by the consent of the instructor only, and is restricted to freshmen and sophomores.  Those wishing to take the course will need to submit an application including a short essay (between one and two pages) on a topic set by the instructor. If you are interested in enrolling, you should contact the instructor by email before Friday, December 1.  Emails should be addressed to ginsborg@berkeley.edu and should include “Philosophy 39” in the subject line.  Those sending emails before the deadline will receive an application form and the essay topic by email, and will have about a week to send back the application.  Students will be informed by mid-December whether they are admitted to the course. Students who are admitted to the course and who attend the first class meeting will receive a class entry code and will be able to enroll through TeleBEARS during the first week of classes.100

Political science seeks to describe, explain, and predict political phenomena.  These questions must be settled empirically: by consulting history, observing differences between countries, taking polls, and so on.  Political philosophy asks different questions, which it is less clear that we can settle empirically.  Some of these questions are conceptual.  What makes a particular form of human interaction political?  Other questions are normative.  What sort of government should we have?  How should we, as individuals, relate to it?This course surveys the major works of political philosophy of the 17thˆ19th centuries, by Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau (in the social contract tradition), and by Hume, Bentham, and Mill (in the utilitarian tradition).  To provide context and contrast, briefer readings will be drawn from Aristotle; Filmer (a critic of Hobbes in turn criticized by Locke); and Whewell, De Tocqueville, and Stephen (contemporaries of Mill).The course will be more interpretive than many philosophy classes.  Although we may hope to learn something about the questions that interest us, we will be discussing, in the first instance, the questions that interested the authors.  Furthermore, our interpretations will have a different focus from courses on the same texts in other departments.  There will be greater emphasis on normative foundations than on institutional design, and greater emphasis on the internal logical structure of the arguments than on their author‚s rhetoric or immediate political aims.  For this reason, some experience with philosophical reasoning is essential.122 
Theory of Knowledge.
Fitelson.
TuTh 12:30-2,
3108 Etcheverry.
This course will be a survey of contemporary epistemology.  The first  part of the course will involve examinations of various sources of  justification and knowledge (including perception, memory,  consciousness, reason, and testimony).  The second part of the course  will be concerned with the structure and growth of justification and  knowledge (this will include topics such as inference and the  extension of knowledge, foundationalism, and coherentism).  The third  and final part of the course will be about the nature and scope of  justification and knowledge and the problem of skepticism (this will  include attempts to analyze knowledge in terms of justification,  truth, and other concepts, naturalistic accounts of knowledge, and  problems for such analyses like the Gettier problem, and  skepticism).  We will use both a textbook and a collection of primary  texts by various epistemologists (mainly, contemporary ones, but also  some ancient and early modern philosophers).Required texts:
“Epistemology: A Contemporary Introduction”, second edition, by  Robert Audi, Routledge.
“Epistemology: Contemporary Readings”, edited by Michael Huemer,  Routledge.Prerequisites: at least one previous philosophy course.128 
Philosophy of Science.
Roush.
MWF 1-2,
110 Wheeler.
This is a course in general philosophy of science. We study five topics of central importance where formal methods, especially probabilistic approaches, have brought progress. We ask: What makes something a scientific explanation?, What is required for observations to confirm (support) a hypothesis?, Is simplicity a guide to truth?, Is coherence a guide to truth?, and Does the success of science give us reason to believe its theories are true? Topics covered include the problem of induction, some paradoxes of confirmation, and the advantages and disadvantages of Bayesianism. Prerequisite: one course in philosophy.135 
Theory of Meaning.
MacFarlane.
TuTh 11-12:30,
213 Wheeler.
I can’t see the planet Pluto, but just by uttering the words “Pluto is
very cold,” I can say something about Pluto, something whose truth or
falsity depends on how things are millions of miles from Earth. How is
this possible? What gives our words and sentences semantic properties
(meaning, reference, truth)? Clearly, the semantic properties of words
depend somehow on our thoughts and intentions: but how? And what gives
our mental states their semantic properties? Are the meanings of our
words and the contents of our mental states determined by what’s going
on inside our brains, or do they depend on features of our physical
environments of which we may be unaware? Are they determined by how
things are now, or do they depend on facts about our history (or even our
futures)? Could there be facts about meaning we could only discover by
looking in someone’s brain? Are there objective facts about meaning at
all? In exploring these and related questions, we will read the work of
Quine, Davidson, Grice, Putnam, Dennett, Searle, Burge, Fodor, Dretske,
and others. Prerequisite: two previous courses in philosophy.136 
Philosophy of Perception.
Noë.
TuTh 12:30-2,
20 Barrows.
What is perception? What is the nature of perceptual consciousness? How can one fit an account of perceptual experience into a broader account of the nature of the mind and the world? The aim of this seminar is to explore these problems. This is a lecture course designed primarily for upper division undegraduate students who have taken at least one course in philosophy. Students in the cognitive sciences (psychology, neuroscience, computer science/robotics, philosophy) are welcome.138 
Philosophy of Society.
Searle.
TuTh 8-9:30,
277 Cory.
How does human society differ from that of other social animals? How is it possible that there can be an objective reality of such things as money, property, government, marriage, and universities, even though such things exist only because we believe they exist? What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail? Are there human rights, and if so what are they and where do they come from?140A 
Intermediate Logic.
Fitelson.
TuTh 9:30-11,
110 Wheeler.
This course has two parts.  Part One (first 11 weeks) will be more  technical
in nature.  It will involve learning some of the key metalogical  results for
first-order logic (e.g., soundness, completeness, and compactness).  The
goal will be to get through Parts 1-3 of Hunter’s “Metalogic” textbook,
which concludes with a famous metalogical paradox called “Skolem’s  Paradox”.
Part Two (last 4 weeks) will be more philosophical in nature.  It will
involve investigating the historical impact (on 20th century analytic
philosophy) of the metalogical results covered in Part One of the  course.
For instance, we will discuss the influence of “Skolem’s Paradox” on the
philosophical development of W.V.O. Quine and Hilary Putnam.Prerequisites. PHIL 12A, and willingness to engage both in  mathematical and
philosophical work.Textbook.  Hunter, “Metalogic,” UC Press 1971.  All other readings  for the

Hume.
Stroud.
MWF 11-12,
2 LeConte.
A four unit course on the philosophy of David Hume (1711-1776), dealing as thoroughly as possible in the time available with many of the central issues of his major works.  Students will be expected to read carefully, to discuss, and to write clearly and perceptively about those works and the problems they raise.  No specific prerequisites; completion of at least Philosophy 25B is strongly advised.  The richer one’s background in philosophy and the more one reads and thinks and discusses with others, the more one will get from the course.  A large body of secondary literature and commentary can be helpful, but the emphasis throughout will be on the words and ideas of Hume himself.Lectures will discuss primarily but not exclusively the following topics: 
    Introduction-the science of human nature;
    Operations of the mind: the theory of impressions and ideas;
    The idea of causation and its source in experience;
    Belief and the sources of beliefs about the unobserved;
    The idea of necessary connection;
    The continued and distinct existence of objects; 
    The self: the idea of personal identity;
    Paradox, sceptical despair and its cure;
    Action and its source in feeling or passion;
    Freedom and necessity;
    Morality and its sources: not derived from reason;
        Feeling, sentiment, and sympathy as the basis of morality;
    The origin and rationale of justice as an ‘artificial virtue’;
    The origin of government and the source of political obligation;
    The human point or goal of philosophy.Course requirements:
    Three lectures per week;
    Participation in one discussion section per week;
    Four five-page papers on selected topics;
    Final examination. 187

Philosophy 187: Special topics in ancient philosophy: Greek political philosophy
M. W. F. 12-1After a survey of the political ideas contained in early Greek poetry, philosophy, and the innovations imported by the Sophists, the course will focus on the political theories of Plato and Aristotle.  In particular, it will work out an analysis of Plato’s views on the ideal state expressed in the Republic and in the Laws and of Aristotle’s notion of the function of the state, the meaning of citizenship and the different kinds of constitutions in the Politics.  Attention will also be given to the changes in the political views of the Hellenistic age – most importantly concerning the Stoic attitude towards the state and citizenship.  189 
Special Topics in Recent European Philosophy: Michel Foucault.
Sluga.
TuTh 9:30-11,
102 Wurster.
The course is meant to serve as an introduction to Foucault’s work and will 
deal with the three phases in the work that Foucault himself distinguished: 
                  his concern with the epistemic structure of knowledge claims 
                  in the human and social sciences (roughly, Foucault’s work in the 
                  1960’s);
                  his preoccupation with power, sexuality, and politics (in the 1970’s);
                  and his examination of the processes of self-formation (in the1980’s).Special attention will be given to Foucault’s middle period. 
The course will focus on a close reading of The Order of Things,
Discipline and Punish, The History of Sexuality, vol. 1,Power/knowledge,
and The Use of Pleasure, plus a reader with a selection of shorter writings.290-1 
Graduate Seminar: ‘Spatial Representation’.
Campbell.
Tu 2-4,

How are we to describe the role of spatial representation in thought  and perception?  What types of spatial representation are there, and  how do they bear on perception of objects?  What is the relation  between spatial representation and first-person thinking?  And  finally, what is the relation between spatial representation and our  understanding of causation?  We will also look at the apparent  diversity of ways of thinking about space found in different cultures.Provisional Syllabus:

In this seminar we will investigate the philosophical foundations of  Aristotle’s biology.  After considering the place of biology in  Aristotle’s philosophy of nature we will look at specific issues  concerning the stuctures involved in biological inquiry and  explanation with particular emphasis on the connection between data  and theory, and the role of final causes (teleology) in biological  explanation.  We will the consider some of the key metaphysical  concepts that are presupposed by his explanatory and definitional  practices in biology, including the nature and role of essentialism  and natural kinds.REQUIRED TEXT:Philosophical Issues in Aristotle’s Biology  (Paperback)

Graduate Seminar: Plato, Theaetetus.
Frede.
W 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
Plato, TheaetetusFor various reasons the Theaetetus is not only crucial for an understanding of Plato’s later philosophy, it also sheds significant light on the earlier dialogues because its central question: ‘What is knowledge?’ underlies Plato’s dialogues right from the Socratic investigations on.  Plato’s treatment of this question raises significant questions: They concern the sceptical atti-tude expressed in the sophist Protagoras’ maxime that man is the measure of all things, and in the flux-theory of the extreme Heracliteans.  A further intriguing problem concerns the status of non-being and saying or thinking what is not.  The dialogue’s negative end, despite some promising manoeuvres, leaves open to speculation what are the ultimate conditions of Plato’s epistemology and metaphysics.  290-4 
Graduate Seminar: Brains and Behavior.
Noë.
W 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
Putnam’s classic paper “Brains and Behavior” argued that the relation between pain and behavior was causal, not constitutive. Apart from its substantive conclusions – that logical behaviorism is false; that pains and other mental states are not dispositions to behave – the paper is a landmark in twentieth-century philosophical methodology raising important questions about how to do philosophy and calling cherished assumptions into question. Among the issues put into play in this paper are: the role of thought experiments in philosophy; the relation between philosophy and science; the limits of verificationism; the relation between conceivability and possibility; the demarcation between epistemology and metaphysics; the distinction between causal and constitutive relationships.The aim of this seminar is to explore themes in the contemporary philosophy of neuroscience and consciousness against the background of the issues raised by Putnam’s original paper. Among the questions we shall examine in this setting are: What is consciousness? Can there be experience without “access consciousness”? Are neural systems alone sufficient for consciousness? Are you your brain? These questions are important and worthwhile in themselves; in thinking about them it is hoped that we can also rethink the legacy of Putnam’s “Brains and Behavior.”Among the philosophical authors we will read in the seminar are: Block, Chalmers, Noë and Putnam. This is a research seminar for graduate students; students may be expected to make presentations. In exceptional circumstances undergraduates will be permitted to take this course.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: Consciousness and Collective Intentionality.
Searle.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
There is a recent growing interest in forms of mental life involving more
 than one person.  Traditional the philosophy of mind takes a single person 
as the locus of mental phenomena.  In this seminar, we will explore those 
forms of intentionality that are essentially social.  We will examine their relation 
to consciousness and the role that they play in the existence of social institutions and social facts generally.290-6

Graduate Seminar: Recent Work in Moral Philosophy.
Wallace.
M 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
Recent Work in Moral PhilosophyThe seminar will be devoted to a close reading of two new works in systematic moral philosophy: The Second-Person Standpoint by Stephen Darwall, and Climbing the Mountain by Derek Parfit. Darwall’s book explores the “essentially interpersonal” character of moral obligation, investigating the implications of this feature of morality for questions about the authority and normative significance of moral demands. Parfit’s (still-unpublished) manuscript attempts to “develop and combine existing [moral] theories of three kinds: Kantian, contractualist, and consequentialist”; he argues that these three theories, when properly interpreted, converge on a single way of understanding moral requirements. The study of these two books should introduce seminar participants to some of the central questions in moral philosophy, while exposing them systematically to the views of two important contemporary philosophers.290-8

The Nature of Mind.
Genone.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
155 Barrows.
This course is designed as an introduction to the philosophical study of
the mind, and also as an introduction to philosophy for those who have not
studied it before. We will investigate a variety of questions, such as:
What is a mind? Can the mental be explained simply in terms of brain
processes? What is involved in having beliefs, desires, and other mental
states that are directed towards the world? How does perception put us in
touch with the world? Students will learn to critically read philosophical
texts, identify and analyze arguments, evaluate various philosophical
views, and will be expected to demonstrate their understanding in
discussion and written work.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Fitelson.
TuWTh 12-2:30,
88 Dwinelle.
Logic is about reasoning, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and how to tell the difference between good and bad reasoning.In this course, we will develop techniques for laying bare the structure of arguments (“reasonings”). This will enable us then to characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These three things — a conception of structure of arguments, a precise characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning — constitute a “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a conclusion.Textbook: Modern Logic by Graeme Forbes, Oxford University Press, 1994.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.

This is a course in Ancient Philosophy.  We will study major works by
Plato and Aristotle which introduced the questions philosophers struggle
with to this day: What are definitions?  What can be defined? What is the
difference between knowledge and belief? How do we explain weakness of
will?  What are the goals of a life well-lived? Are there rules for being
moral?  Why should we have friends?25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Beattie.
MTuWTh 2-4,
215 Dwinelle.
This course will survey some of the major works of
modern western philosophy, i.e. philosophy from Europe
during roughly the 17th and 18th centuries.  The
Scientific Revolution had only recently kicked off and
was developing rapidly during this time, and the
philosophy we will be looking at was hugely affected
by this phenomenon.  We will be examining the two
primary philosophical approaches ? now known as
Rationalism and Empiricism ? that arose to deal with
the pressing issues of the time; two questions, in
particular, will be the focus of the course, one
metaphysical and the other epistemological.  The first
asks about the basic structure of reality (about the
nature of God, of mind, of material things, etc.)
while the second asks how we as thinkers/perceivers
relate to the world around us (do we know it?s out
there at all?  If so, how?).115 
Political Philosophy.
Kolodny.
WThF 10-12:30,

What sort of political institutions should we have?  How should we relate to them?  Why?  This course considers contemporary attempts to answer these questions.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California2 
Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Callard.
MTuW 12-2:30,
210 Wheeler.
An introduction to ethics, which is the attempt to provide a systematic
and general answer to the question: how should we behave? The focus will
be on moral theory–that is, on the theory of what we are morally
obligated or permitted to do (or refrain from doing) and why–but we will
also explore how the demands that morality makes on us interact with other
reasons for action.We will address various concrete moral issues, including the morality of
capital punishment, abortion, war, affirmative action, and taxation. We
will also take up more abstract questions: do moral statements purport to
represent objective moral facts, or are they instead expressions of the
feelings of the person making the statement? If they try to represent
objective moral facts, do they succeed? If there are objective moral
facts, are they relative to time, the culture of the agent, etc.; or are
they independent of these frameworks?4 
Knowledge & Its Limits.
Bezsylko.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
109 Dwinelle.
The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to philosophy by taking up just one of its many and varied topics: knowledge.   We will consider three big questions.  What is knowledge?  Do we have any knowledge?   What are some of the general kinds of knowledge to be had?  We will draw on some of the very best philosophical texts, old and new, that engage with these questions.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Karbowski.
MTuWTh 12-2,
223 Dwinelle.
This course is a general introduction to the central philosophical doctrines of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  We will focus on the ethical, metaphysical, and epistemological doctrines of these philosophers, with an emphasis on the methodology they use in arguing for their conclusions.  Among the issues we will discuss are their views of the best human life, the nature of the soul, the fundamental constituents of reality, scientific explanation, and the difference between knowledge and true belief.  In addition to attempting to understand the views of these philosophers and why they held them, we will critically assess the merits of the views in question.  Thus, this course also doubles as an introduction to philosophy.  As such, it presupposes no background in philosophy.188 
Phenomenology.
Moural.
MTuW 10-12:30,
130 Wheeler.
Phenomenology was – besides analytic philosophy – one of the two great philosophical movements of the 20th century. It has been praised for addressing topics more relevant to real people’s life, but blamed for relatively lower standards of clarity and for failure to deliver on its over-ambitious goals. It has been more influential than analytic philosophy outside of academic philosophy (and is thus important in many areas of cultural studies), and within philosophy there have been repeated attempts to combine the life-relevance of phenomenology with the clarity and modesty of analysis.In this course, we shall focus on close reading and critical explanation of selections from three classics of the movement, Edmund Husserl’s Cartesian Meditations (1929) and Crisis of European Sciences (1936) and Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception (1945). 1st weekHusserl, /Cartesian Meditations/ (§§ 1-20)2nd weekHusserl, /Cartesian Meditations/ (§§ 21-41, 63-64)3rd weekHusserl, /Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology/ (§§ 1-16 and Supplement VI.)4th weekHusserl, /Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology/ (§§ 33-55)5th weekMerleau-Ponty, /Phenomenology of Perception/ (tba)6th weekMerleau-Ponty, /Phenomenology of Perception/ (tba)Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California2

Kolodny.
MWF 9-10,
145 Dwinelle.
In this course, we will survey the basic questions of moral and political philosophy, as well as some classic attempts to answer them. The questions that we will ask include: What is the morally right thing for me to do? Why should I do it? Is there a fact of the matter what it is, or does it just depend on my feelings or upbringing? Why should I do what the government tells me to? Why should I tolerate alien moral beliefs and practices? The philosophers whose work we will read include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Bentham, Mill, and Nietzsche.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Campbell.
TuTh 2-3:30,
120 Latimer.
In this course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five units in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Personal Identity, Functionalism, Consciousness, and Causation. The books required for the course are: David Chalmers (ed.), Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002). John Perry (ed.), Personal Identity, (Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press 1975).What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? We shall begin the course by looking at these fundamental questions about the nature of the psychological. What is a person? Is a person merely a biological entity, and the identity of a person just the identity of a physical thing? Do psychological states enter into the identity of the self, or can we explain the continued existence of the self in terms that do not appeal to psychological states? And what is the importance of personal identity? Recently some theorists have argued that we should give it much less weight than we seem to ordinarily; we will look at those arguments. One of the most powerful ideas in contemporary philosophy of mind is functionalism, the idea that the character of a mental state is constituted by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior. In the third unit we look at the strengths and limitations of this idea. One limitation of functionalism is its trouble in providing an analysis of consciousness. What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? We will try to identify the aspects of conscious experience that make it difficult to explain this characteristic of the mental life in physicalist terms. In one way or another, throughout this course we will be going over the relation of the psychological life to the physical. Finally, we will look at how psychological states can be said to have causes and effects. Do we in fact ordinarily take it that psychological states do have causes and effects? And can they do so, if the whole causal story of the world can be told entirely in terms of physics?12A

Ancient Philosophy.
MacFarlane.
MWF 11-12,
145 Dwinelle.
This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy–and, for the
uninitiated, to philosophy itself. We will spend almost all of our time
on the three most important Greek philosophers–Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle–with a passing glance at pre-Socratic and Hellenistic
philosophers. Our primary goal will be to understand these philosophers’
characteristic methods and views, and (more importantly) their reasons
for holding these views. It is often said that we should study ancient
Greek philosophy because it is the intellectual basis for all later
western philosophy and natural science. That is true, but it is only
half the story. We should also study ancient Greek philosophy to become
familiar with a worldview so alien that it throws our own into sharp
relief. As you are outraged by some of the things these philosophers
say, you will come to see more clearly what your own views are, and you
will be forced to ask what justifies them. You will not just be studying
the history of philosophy; you will be doing philosophy. Prerequisite:

Topics to be discussed include the following: the nature and significance of character; reason, emotion, and moral motivation; regret and remorse; caring, love, and personal attachment; identification and alienation; weakness of the will; and practical necessity.  Readings will be drawn from a range of contemporary sources, including articles and books by Frankfurt, Moran, Velleman, Watson, and Williams. 116 
Special Topics in Political Philosophy: Equality and Needs.
Munoz-Dardé.
W 2-5,
2519 Tolman.
This course will be taught in seminar format, with one weekly three-hour
meeting and enrollment limited to twenty students. The topic of the
seminar is equality and needs. Issues that will be raised include the
following: How should we understand the political ideal of equality?
Is there is something which justice requires people to have equal
amounts of? If so, what? If not, is what matters that we have sufficient
resources for flourishing? Should we give priority to the least
well-off? What is the connection between the values of equality and
fairness?The course is intended for juniors and seniors with substantial
background in philosophy. Philosophy 115 or the equivalent is a
prerequisite, and the course will presuppose familiarity with Rawls’ A
Theory of Justice. Readings will be drawn from a range of historical
and contemporary sources: Rousseau, G. A. Cohen, Temkin, Dworkin,
Raz, Frankfurt, Scanlon, Nagel, Scheffler, Parfit, Griffins, Foot and
Wiggins.122 
Theory of Knowledge.
Roush.

By any (reasonable) account, human beings have more knowledge today than ever before due to the progress of science, but there is still philosophical disagreement about what knowledge is, how we should respond to radical skepticism, and how much science itself can tell us about knowledge. In this problem-oriented course we will study contemporary classics of epistemology on the topics of tracking, closure, relevant alternatives, reliabilism, internalism, externalism, and contextualism, among others.  We will take epistemology to be responsible for understanding scientific cases of knowledge, and also consider the implications for epistemology of results in experimental psychology suggesting human beings’ lack of awareness of their true reasons for belief.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Martin.
MWF 1-2,
160 Kroeber.
From the earliest point in our lives we mark a distinction between the social world of animate beings and the inanimate objects about us. The distinctions we make are fundamental to our ways of finding out about the world and responding to what we discover there. But do the distinctions we mark reflect ultimate differences in the nature of the world around us? These are the questions addressed in this course. We will be looking at some of the oldest and most fundamental questions about the mind: the nature of consciousness, knowledge of our own minds and of others’; physicalism and dualism; functionalism.140B 
Intermediate Logic.
Mancosu.
TuTh 9:30-11,

This course covers some of the most important metalogical results that are of interest to philosophers. It is divided into three parts. The first two parts are mathematical in style whereas the last part is philosophical. In the first part we will cover the basic notions of computability theory and study in detail the Turing machine approach to computability. The second part of the course will give a detailed presentation of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and related results. Finally, we will look at the philosophical relevance of these logical results to various areas of philosophy.
Prerequisite: 12A (or equivalent) or permission from the instructor.
Course requirements: exercise sets approximately every ten days (counting for 60% of final grade) and a philosophical paper due at the end of the semester (40% of final grade).Textbooks:Boolos, Burgess, Jeffrey,_ Computability and Logic_, 4th ed., Cambridge University Press, 2003 (2nd printing; check corrections at http://www.princeton.edu/~jburgess/addenda.htm)Reader on the philosophical significance of Turing’s computability and Gödel’s incompleteness theorems for several areas of philosophy (to be chosen among philosophy of mind, philosophy of logic, philosophy of language, philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics).http://philosophy.berkeley.edu/people/page/36160 
Plato.
Ebrey.
TuTh 9:30-11,
126 Barrows.
How should we be living our lives? We will begin the class with this basic
question raised by Plato’s teacher, Socrates. Trying to answer this question
will eventually lead Plato to make some quite strange claims: the sensible
world is fundamentally unintelligible on its own, definitions are not to be
found in the sensible world, our souls are immortal and contain within them
all knowledge, and we should be ruled by philosopher-kings. How does Plato
start with such a simple question about how to live our lives and end with
such radical claims about politics and the universe as a whole?Plato’s intellectual development begins with his teacher, Socrates,
searching for definitions of the things found in the best lives – things
such as courage, justice, piety and temperance. After examining this
Socratic project, we will follow Plato as he develops the project in his own
directions. One way he develops it is by thinking, not just about how we
should live our individual lives, but also about how we should organize
ourselves politically. Plato also thinks that non-ethical concerns arise
from Socrates’ search for definition in ethics. A basic concern Plato has
is: how can we acquire this knowledge that Socrates is searching for?
Further, what are these definitions that Socrates seeks – where in the world
could one find such a thing? Moreover, Plato becomes interested in how we
can make sense, not of our own lives, but of the world we observe around us.
The course will focus on close reading skills to try to unearth how Plato
argues for such strange and radical answers to these questions.Prerequisite: Philosophy 25A174 
Locke.
Ayers.
TuTh 11-12:30,
210 Wheeler.
Locke’s Essay concerning Human Understanding, published in 1689, is one of the few most influential works in general philosophy that have ever been written.  Locke’s was a leading voice in favor of a reasonable, tolerant, and anti-dogmatic  (more or less ‘modern’) approach to the natural world, to society and to religion.  His theory of knowledge, part of this wider campaign, was supported by shrewd and subtle philosophical argument that was highly respected throughout Europe for well over a century – even by such opponents and critics as Leibniz and Kant.  Since then it has often been underrated and misrepresented, but his thought is of great philosophical as well as historical interest and importance.The Essay is a long book, and is constructed in an order that would have been more familiar to his first readers.  Ayers’ Locke follows a rather different order, but is also regrettably long.  Students who take this course will not be expected to read either ‘required’ book from beginning to end (though they won’t be discouraged from doing so).  We will start by reading a selection of passages taken from different parts of the Essay, not necessarily with the aim of explaining the structure and philosophical motivation of Locke’s theories – an overall grasp of his strategy.  Then we shall look at specific arguments and questions of interpretation in greater detail, as well as exploring the wider philosophical issues that they raise.  The latter include the nature of knowledge and its relation to belief, the basic role of the senses, what thinking is, the relation between physical and logical necessity, the relations between language, thought and reality (for example, how far our classifications have an objective basis in reality), and what the identity of things and persons consists in.  (A lot of work has been done on Locke since I wrote about him, and I expect to have to revise some earlier views.)A student unfamiliar with the Essay might usefully look first at the following passages (about 190 pages in all). They do not include some very important topics (eg identity, classification, estimation of probability, the relation between faith and reason), but should give an overall idea of what Locke is about.Book I ch I,  ch ii,  and ch iv sections 1-3 and 22-25;
Book II ch I sects 1-10 and 20-25,  chs ii-viii,  ch xiii 1-5,  ch xiv sects 1-5,  ch xvi, ch xvii sects 1-3 and 22, chs xix and xx, ch xxi sects 1-4,  ch xxii,  ch xxiii sects 1-12 and 37, ch xxv and ch xxxi.

Kant.
Warren.
TuTh 2-3:30,

In this course we will examine some of the major metaphysical and epistemological themes of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. We will be focusing particularly on Kant’s views on the following topics: a priori knowledge and how it is possible, space and time, objectivity and experience, self-knowledge, and the contrast between appearances and things in themselves. Several short papers and a longer paper will be required. Prerequisite: Philosophy 25B185

One of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century, Being and Time is both a systematization of the existential insights of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and a radicalization of Husserl’s phenomenological account of intentionality.  What results is an original interpretation of the human condition and an account of the nature and limitations of philosophical and scientific theory.  This account has important implications for all those disciplines that study human beings. Required text:

This seminar will trace the historical and philosophical development  of confirmation theory (aka., pure and applied inductive logic) from  1900-2007.  The main historical figures will include (among others):  Johnson, Keynes, Nicod, Hempel, Carnap, Goodman, Quine, Salmon,  Skyrms, Joyce, and yours truly.  All readings will be provided on the  seminar website.  [There are no prerequisites for this seminar, but  it will presuppose some basic propositional logic and high-school  algebra.]290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Plato’s Sophist.
Frede.
M 4-6,
223 Wheeler.
The Seminar will study Plato’s Sophist, one of his latest works.  In the
search of the definition of the sophist the participants of the dialogue
focus on central concepts such as being and not-being, on the nature of
language, and on questions of methodology.  The Sophist is by general
consent one of Plato’s hardest, but also most rewarding works for the
understanding of his philosophy.
The seminar will provide a careful analysis of the arguments and a study
of the dialogue’s unity and its relation to other Platonic works.  At the
same time a series of articles will be included that have contributed most
to a better understanding of this complex dialogue in recent years.290-3

Graduate Seminar: Appearance and Expression.
Martin.
W 4-6,
283 Dwinelle.
Tomatoes have a characteristic look. Some tomatoes lack this look, and other entities – fake tomatoes – can possess the look and thereby mislead someone about what they are. Nonetheless when you see a tomato in plain view you can see it for what it is, a tomato: that something is a tomato would seem to be a perceptible aspect of it. When someone feels resentful, that attitude may be expressed in the way they look at others, how they move, or in the manner of their speech. A skilled actor can mimic such expressions so as to appear resentful too. This doesn’t rule out our coming to know in propitious circumstances that someone is resentful just by looking at them or listening to them. Yet many think that the person’s resentment is not itself a perceptible aspect of the scene: our access to it is mediated through the person’s behaviour or what is expressive of this feeling.Why should one suppose that there is this difference between the appearance of kinds of fruit and the expressions of feeling or emotion? That is the question we shall be pursuing in this seminar. The aim will be to look at some of the traditional discussions of the problem of other minds; the elusive status of appearance; and the relation between emotional states and their expression.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: Rawl’s Theory of Justice.
Munoz-Dardé.
M 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
The purpose of the seminar is to present and assess Rawls’s seminal 
book in its entirety, as a single project, placing it in its 
historical and ethical wider context. This will allow us a.) to 
highlight the importance of Rawls’s ambition to rival classical 
utilitarians in shaping the form of his theory; and b.) to bring to 
light how TJ constitutes a systematic theory embracing moral 
doctrines and social and economic facts, at the same time placing 
them in a contractualist framework.The seminar will focus on Rawls’s conception of justice, as 
developed in the revised edition of A Theory of Justice (TJ), and 
Justice as Fairness a Restatement (JRF). JFR is a succinct, revised 
statement of the idea of justice as fairness. In it, Rawls recasts 
the basic arguments for the two principles central to his conception 
of justice, responds to common objections, but also corrects what he 
came to see as mistakes in TJ. By going back and forth between TJ 
and the mature statement of the theory in JRF, the seminar will 
address interpretative questions regarding the very idea of Justice 
as Fairness, the Original Position and the knowledge that the 
parties are in possession of or deprived from, the idea of 
Reflective Equilibrium, the Basic Structure as subject, the 
Difference Principle, Reasonable Overlapping Consensus, and the 
difference between Political Liberalism and Comprehensive Liberalism.290-6 
Graduate Seminar: Self-monitoring and Rationality.
Roush.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
We examine the thesis that justified belief requires not access to one’s own mind but rather the distinct, and often non-conscious, capacity of self-monitoring, and that the purpose of self-monitoring is self-correction. We discuss notions of justified belief in epistemology and Bayesianism, consider a new self-monitoring notion of justified belief based on second-order tracking, and relate it to the notion of calibration in Bayesianism, statistics, and psychologists’ studies of human beings’ confidence/accuracy ratios. We apply the new self-monitoring rationality requirements proposed for the relation between first- and second-order beliefs to the Preface Paradox, Moore’s Paradox, the Commitment Paradox, the Paradox of Entailment, and the problem of formulating fallibilism, in order to explain both why there is a tension in each of these cases and why there is nevertheless no contradiction290-7 
Graduate Seminar: Global Justice.
Scheffler.
W 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
Global JusticeThere is a vigorous debate among political philosophers about whether there are norms of distributive justice that apply to the world as a whole.  The primary aim of the seminar will be to take stock of this debate.  In order to do this, we will need to consider a number of related issues, including the moral legitimacy of partiality toward those with whom one has special ties, the moral significance of shared citizenship in particular, the question whether principles of justice apply primarily to individuals or to institutions, the relations between justice and beneficence, and the extent to which affluent individuals have a responsibility to help alleviate poverty and suffering in distant lands.  We will read the works of a number of contemporary authors, including most or all of the following: John Rawls, Thomas Nagel, Charles Beitz, Peter Singer, Richard Miller, Onora O’Neill, Thomas Pogge, Samuel Freeman, A.J. Julius, Michael Blake, Kok-Chor Tan, Garrett Cullity, Andrea Sangiovanni, Joshua Cohen and Charles Sabel, Ronald Dworkin, Mathias Risse, Brian Barry, Allan Buchanan, and Liam Murphy.290-8 
Graduate Seminar.
Ayers.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
The intention is to consider three closely related philosophical topics : 1, the identity and individuation of material objects;
2, the content  and objects of perception and perceptual knowledge;
3, the nature and content of self-knowledge and self-awareness.  Argument will be advanced, from a realist point of view, in supportive explanation of ordinary ways of thinking and talking about people, things, and perception.  A sceptical view will be taken of attempts by analytic philosophers to improve on these basic ways of thinking, for example by proposing surprising ‘analyses’ of natural language, or radically alternative  ontologies and logics.   The idea that intentionality and content are primarily properties of linguistic items of some kind will also be subjected to criticism.  We are animals, and language has evolved on the back of animal experience of the world, including experience of ourselves in the world.   To understand how this is so (it will be suggested) is to begin to understand the structure of natural language.295

MWF 10-11,
160 Kroeber.
This course will comprise an introduction to central topics in Epistemology through
historical and contemporary readings. In particular, we will address skeptical doubts
about the possibility of knowledge, the nature of knowledge of various kinds, and the
basis on which we can have such knowledge. No prerequisites.7 
Existentialism in Literature&Film.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 3:30-5,
145 Dwinelle.
The course will be organized around various attempts to reinterpret the Judeo/Christian God, and to determine in what sense, if at all, such a God is still a living God. We will study Dostoyevsky’s and Kierkegaard’s attempts to preserve a non-theological version of the God of Christianity, as well as Nietzche’s attempt to save us from belief in any version of God offered by our tradition. We will view and discuss three films that deal with related issues.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Mancosu.
MWF 9-10,
2040 Valley.
The course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicate the intuitive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’) and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’). In addition, we will also develop techniques for showing when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus.

Modern Philosophy.
Ginsborg.
MWF 11-12,
145 Dwinelle.
The course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics. We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.100 
Philosophical Methods.

This course is restricted to Philosophy majors. It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy. Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills. This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the problem of personal identity. There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading. In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper.Course readings: /Personal Identity/, edited by John Perry, University of California Press.108 
Contemporary Ethical Issues.
Kolodny.
TuTh 9:30-11,
102 Wurster.
As a thoughtful person, living in this country, at this time, you  have at some point asked yourself some of the following questions.
Should torture be allowed?  Is there any difference between terrorism  and “collateral damage”?  May we kill enemy soldiers or even  civilians to protect ourselves?  Is capital punishment moral?  Is  abortion?  Whether or not it’s moral, should it be legal?  Should we  let the majority or the courts decide?  Is the government allowed to  take your money and use it in ways you don’t want?  If you have  better grades and higher test scores, do you deserve a spot at UC  more?  Are you allowed to buy yourself an iPod when you could use the  money to save people from starving?  Should you buy a hybrid, rather  than an SUV, when your individual choice is just “a drop in the  bucket” and won’t really affect global warming?These questions can be difficult for many different reasons.  Self- interest, prejudice, and fear can cloud our judgment.  Religious  authorities that we accept on faith, such as the Bible, can give  unclear or conflicting directions.  Finally, it can be hard to be  sure of relevant facts: for example, whether information gained  through torture tends to be reliable, whether the justice system  applies the death penalty consistently, or whether burning fossil  fuels leads to climate change.This course, however, is about another set of difficulties, which  persist when we set aside our personal feelings, we see how far we  can get without relying on faith, and we assume that we know the  relevant facts.  We may not be able to decide, by our own reflection  and reasoning, which answers are correct, and even when we are sure  that certain answers are correct, we may not be able to justify  them.  Our ethical ideas may seem not up to the task.  Our aim in  this course is to come to terms with these difficulties and to see to  what extent they can be overcome.115

The main purpose of this course is to answer the question ?How does
language relate to the world?? In order to do this we will have to
explore a lot of related questions, such as those concerning the nature
of truth, reference, meaning, speech acts, metaphors, fiction, and
pictures. We will also try to develop a general theoretical account of
how human linguistic behavior is related to the rest of human behavior
and to human mental states.142 
Philosophical Logic.
MacFarlane.
TuTh 12:30-2,
145 McCone.
“Philosophical logic” includes both (a) the philosophical investigation
of the fundamental concepts of logic and (b) the deployment of logical
methods in the service of philosophical ends. We’ll tackle five
interconnecting topics in philosophical logic:Quantifiers: You may think you learned everything there is
to know about quantifiers in Philosophy 12A. But in fact, there are
quite a few quantificational idioms that we can’t understand in terms
of the quantification theory you learned. We’ll look at the logic of
identity, numerical quantifiers, generalized quantifiers, definite
descriptions, substitutional quantifiers, and plural quantifiers.Modal logic:  In addition to talking about what is the case,
we talk about what might have been the case and what could not have
been otherwise.  Modal logic gives us tools to analyze reasoning
involving these notions. We’ll get a basic grasp on some of the
fundamentals of propositional modal logic, and then delve into some
hairy conceptual problems surrounding quantified modal logic,
explored by Quine, Kripke, and others. We’ll also look at the famous
“slingshot argument,” which was used by Quine and Davidson to reject
modal logic and correspondence theories of truth. At this point our
work on definite descriptions will come in handy!Logical consequence: If you ask what logic is about, a reasonable
(though not completely satisfactory) answer is that it’s the study
of what follows from what, that is, of logical consequence. But how
should we think of this relation? We’ll start by looking at Tarski’s
account of logical consequence, which has become the orthodox
account. On this account, logical consequence is a matter of
truth preservation:
P follows from Q if there is no model on which P
is true and Q false. We’ll talk about how this account relates to
the older idea that P follows from Q if it is impossible for
P to be true and Q false. Then we’ll consider some alternatives.
One alternative is to define consequence in terms of proof. We’ll
look at a version of this idea by Dag Prawitz, which yields a
nonclassical logic called “intuitionistic logic.”  We’ll then look
at the suggestion that relevance in addition to truth preservation
is required for logical consequence. We’ll see how one might
develop a nonclassical “relevance logic,” and we’ll consider some
technical and philosophical issues that speak for and against a
requirement of relevance. Finally, we’ll consider how, exactly, logic
relates to reasoning.Conditionals: In Philosophy 12A you were taught to translate
English conditionals using the “material conditional,” a
truth-functional connective. This leads to some odd results: for
example, “If I am currently on Mars, then I am a hippopotamus”
comes out true (since the antecedent is false). We’ll start by
considering some attempts to defend the material-conditional analysis
of indicative conditionals in English. Then we’ll consider some
alternatives, inculding Edgington’s view that indicative conditionals
have no truth-conditions, Stalnaker’s elegant modal account, and the
view that indicative conditionals should be understood as conditional
assertions. Finally, we’ll look at McGee’s “counterexample to modus
ponens,” and consider whether this sacrosanct inference rule is
actually invalid!Vagueness: Finally we’ll turn to the “sorites paradox,” or
paradox of the heap, which argues:  five thousand grains of sand
make a heap; taking one grain away from a heap still leaves you
with a heap; so…one grain of sand makes a heap.  Philosophical
logicians have suggested that it is a mistake to use classical
logic and semantics in analyzing this argument, and they have
proposed a number of alternatives.  We’ll consider three of them:
(a) a three-valued logic, (b) a continuum-valued (or fuzzy) logic,
and © a supervaluational approach that preserves classical
logic (mostly) but not classical semantics.  If there’s time, we’ll
also look at a short argument by Gareth Evans that purports to
show that vagueness must be a semantic phenomenon:  that is, that
there is no vagueness “in the world.”Requirements will include both papers and problem sets.Prerequisites:  Philosophy 12A or equivalent, and at least one other
course in philosophy.  The course covers some technical material,
but knowledge of logic beyond 12A will not be assumed.Books: Course Reader.148 
Probability & Induction.
Fitelson.
TuTh 11-12:30,
103 Moffitt.
What is probability? How is probability useful for understanding  inductive inference? Is there such a thing as inductive logic? If  so, how does it relate to deductive logic, and what role does  probability play in inductive logic? And, how is inductive logic  related to inductive epistemology? These are the main (general)  questions we will address in this course. Some specific topics  we’ll discuss are: Hempel’s paradox of confirmation, Goodman’s “new  riddle of induction”, Carnapian inductive logic, contemporary  Bayesian confirmation theory and Bayesian epistemology, and various  puzzles and paradoxes involving probability and evidence.Prerequisites. PHIL 12A, and willingness to engage both in  mathematical and philosophical work.All readings for the course will be provided via the course website.149 
Special Topics in the Philosophy of Logic & Mathematics: Theories of Truth.
Mancosu.
MWF 1-2,
220 Wheeler Hall.
The course is devoted to a detailed study of the two major formal theories of truth developed in the twentieth century, e.g. Tarski’s (1935) and Kripke’s (1975). When trying to articulate the principles capturing the logic of truth predicates in natural language our intuition leads immediately to the request that the theory should yield all biconditionals of the form “‘p’ is true iff p”. But the liar paradox shows that this naïve principle for truth, together with classical logic, leads to contradiction. Tarski’s solution rests on the distinction between object language (L) and metalanguage (ML) and on imposing as an adequacy condition for a theory of truth that the metalanguage be able to prove all the biconditionals of the above form, where p is restricted to sentences of the object language. Since the truth predicate for L is expressible in ML but not in L, the liar, and similar paradoxes, are blocked. Tarski’s approach dominated the field for forty years. Kripke in 1975 developed a  formal theory of truth using a three valued logic. In his approach paradoxical statements turn out to be neither true nor false. Kripke’s construction leads to a theory of truth in which the truth predicate for L is expressible in L itself. The importance of Tarski’s and Kripke’s theories of truth cannot be overstated; indeed, they are required for a proper understanding of all other formal theories of truth that have been proposed in the last thirty years (revision theory, etc.).
Students taking this course will be required to do a substantial amount of logical work. In the process they will learn topics such as, among others, basics of set theory, many valued logics, fixed points and inductive definitions. Of course, the philosophical implications of Tarski’s and Kripke’s theories will also be discussed. The formal prerequisite is 12A (Introduction to Logic). Familiarity with either Phil 140A or Phil 140B will be an advantage but material covered in those courses will not be presupposed.Textbook: Vann McGee, Truth, Vagueness, and Paradox.

Aristotle.
Frede.
MWF 10-11,
170 Barrows.
The course provides a survey of the main areas of Aristotle’s works in the fields of logic, metaphysics, natural science, psychology and ethics/politics.  It will end with a brief review of his poetics and rhetoric.  Since Aristotle was concerned with working out the basic principles of each subject and the corresponding methodology, a proper understanding of those princi-ples will be one of the course’s main concerns.  Given the wide scope of Aristotle’s interests the course will have to confine itself to selective investigations of the application Aristotle makes of his principles in the different fields of study.  Since Aristotle’s works are hard to access because of his terse style the readings will focus in the main on an analysis of the se-lected texts taken from (ed.) J. L. Ackrill: A New Aristotle Reader

How did he think  mind and body were united and interacted?  We will examine his  commitment to mechanistic science, his rejection of Aristotelianism,
and consider his use of skepticism and the role of God in his system.184

The purpose of the course is to give a survey of  the development of German idealistic thought from Kant to the early Schelling. It will deal mainly with the metaphysical  and the epistemological aspects of this movement and focus primarily on those aspects that are related to Kant’s theoretical philosophy. 
Topics that are dealt with include:  (1)  Kant’s criticism of metaphysics and his epistemological program, (2) reactions to Kant’s approach by F.H.Jacobi, K.L.Reinhold and G.E.Schulze. (3) Fichte’s ‘subjective’ idealism, (4) Schelling’s search for ‘lacking premisses’.

Aristotle’s ‘De Anima’_ (On the Soul) is an attempt to provide a general account of the
soul and psychological faculties and phenomena within the framework, as much as
possible, of his program of natural science. This course will be devoted to a close
reading of Aristotle?s De Anima both within its historical context and in light of
contemporary debates concerning the work, especially its significance for post-Cartesian
philosophy of psychology.In addition to the usual requirements, participation and presentation of short writing
assignments will be required. Philosophy 25A is a prerequisite.This course requires a Class Entry Code for admission. Please contact the instructor (andreasa@berkeley.edu) for details.189

Graduate Seminar: Assessment Sensitivity.
MacFarlane.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
We will examine the idea that some of the things we think and say are assessment-sensitive—that is, true or false only relative to a “context of assessment.” We will be concerned with three main issues:How can we make room for assessment sensitivity in existing
semantic frameworks?  To what extent is provision for assessment
sensitivity a natural extension of these frameworks?How can we make philosophical sense of assessment sensitivity?
What does it mean to say that what is asserted or believed is
true or false only relative to a context of assessment?  What
are the costs of saying this? To what extent is this form of
relativism subject to the usual philosophical objections?What is the motivation for positing assessment sensitivity?  What phenomena can we explain by doing so?  What are the prospects for alternative (and perhaps less radical) explanations of these phenomena?For the sake of concreteness, we will focus first on “predicates of personal taste” (paradigmatically, “tasty”), and then on epistemic and deontic modals. In addition to newer literature that directly concerns assessment sensitivity, we will read some classic literature (both on semantics and on evaluative concepts, obligations, and possibility) that the newer work builds on.Prerequisites: This seminar is primarily intended for graduate
students in Philosophy and Logic and the Methodology of Science.
Other students should seek my permission before continuing. I will not presuppose much background in the philosophy of language, but it would be good if everyone were familiar with the following three articles: Gottlob Frege, “The Thought: A Logical Inquiry” (English translation in Mind 65, 1956, pp. 289-311); H.

In this seminar, I want to explore a series of problems in the philosophy of language.

Second, I would like to give a defense of internalism against current externalist attacks on it.  Third, I would like to explain some of my current ideas on the relation of language and social ontology.290-5

Graduate Seminar: Permissibility and Meaning.
Wallace/Kolodny.
M 2-4,

Permissibility and Meaning. Themes from the Recent Work of T. M. Scanlon What are we thinking about, when we think about the “morality” of actions? A theme of T.M. Scanlon’s recent work is that we may be thinking about more than one thing. On the one hand, we may be trying to decide what to do. Within this deliberative perspective, Scanlon suggests, we focus on questions of permissibility. On the other hand, we may be trying to come to terms with what someone’s action says about him, or about his relations to others. Within this evaluative perspective, we focus on questions of meaning. Scanlon suggests that sustained and careful attention to the distinction between permissibility and meaning, or more broadly between the deliberative and evaluative perspectives, promises to illuminate several central questions in ethics. Does what we intend affect the morality what we do? How should we understand the resonant idea that morality is a matter of treating people as “ends, not means”? What is blame? When is it appropriate? Only when it is for something freely chosen? Does what we ought to do depend on the facts, or only the evidence available to us? Does intending something affect what we have reason to do? To provide background, we will begin by reviewing the central chapters of Scanlon’s What We Owe to Each Other. Then we will focus on Scanlon’s unpublished book, Dimensions of Moral Assessment: Meaning, Permissibility, and Blame290-7 
Graduate Seminar: Unity of the Self in 17th&18th c. Philosophy.
Warren/Rozemond.
W 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
This seminar will take as its starting point two connected issues: the simplicity of the self and the identity of the self.  The former concerns whether or in what sense the mind could be made up of distinct parts, which is sometimes described as a question about unity at a time; the latter concerns whether or in what sense the mind is something that can persist through change of state, i.e., has unity over time.  Both of these issues are addressed by Kant in the “Paralogisms” section of the Critique of Pure Reason, and play a central role in the “Transcendental Deduction.”  However they were also discussed in depth and considered of fundamental philosophical importance by many philosophers of the early modern period prior to Kant.  Issues concerning the simplicity and identity of the self were thought of as tied to a number of concerns: whether the self could be a material thing, whether the self is a substance and whether that question is answerable by us or even intelligible, whether such skepticism about the self’s being a substance led to consequences that were in some way unacceptable, what the nature of thought and self-awareness is, and what this entails regarding these questions about the self.  We will be discussing the views of Descartes, Locke, Bayle, Clarke, Leibniz, Hume, and finally Kant, on the unity of the self and some of these related questions.  Roughly half the seminar will be  devoted to early modern philosophers before Kant, half to Kant.290-8 
Graduate Seminar: Plato’s Meno.
Ebrey.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
This course will focus on a close reading of Plato’s Meno. Plato seems to
have written the Meno soon after he wrote the early Socratic dialogues and
the Meno addresses many of the basic ethical topics found in these
dialogues: the search for an ethical definition (in this case, “what is
virtue?”), the idea that no one desires what is bad, and the question of
whether virtue is teachable. The Meno breaks from Plato’s earlier writings
by being the first dialogue in which Plato directly discusses
epistemological issues. The topics he raises are of fundamental importance:
whether inquiry is possible, how to use hypotheses in philosophy, how to
distinguish between knowledge and true belief, and why we should value
knowledge. This course will examine these topics through a close reading of
the text, using secondary literature as an aid. We will also look at
relevant passages from other Platonic dialogues so we can think about how
this dialogue fits into Plato’s overall philosophical development.
Throughout the course, I will put particular emphasis on how these new
epistemological questions raise potential difficulties for the ethical
project laid out in the early Socratic dialogues and how Plato’s response to
these questions is designed to resolve these difficulties, thereby securing
Socrates’ ethical project.290-9

problems about the mind. In the first three weeks, we will focus on the
relationship between the mind and the physical world. We will pursue the
following questions:What is a mind? What are mental states such as beliefs, desires,
feelings and experiences? Are they states of the brain? Are they a
matter of how one behaves? Could a computer have a mind?In the second three weeks, we will look in detail at some more specific
issues raised by our discussion of the questions above:What is the connection between consciousness and the capacity to
represent the world around us (to have mental states which are /about
/the world)? Are mental states in the head? In what ways do they depend
on the world around us? How do we know about other people?s minds?We will read work by philosophers including Hilary Putnam, John Searle
and Thomas Nagel. Students taking the course will be expected to read
this work closely and carefully. They will also be required to write two
papers and sit a final exam.12A

This course will survey some of the major works of modern western philosophy, i.e. philosophy from Europe during roughly the 17^th and 18^th centuries. The Scientific Revolution had only recently kicked off and was developing rapidly during this time, and the philosophy we will be looking at was hugely affected by this phenomenon. We will be examining the two primary philosophical approaches – now known as Rationalism and Empiricism – that arose to deal with the pressing issues of the time; two questions, in particular, will be the focus of the course, one metaphysical and the other epistemological. The first asks about the basic structure of reality (about the nature of God, of mind, of material things, etc.) while the second asks how we as thinkers/perceivers relate to the world around us (do we know it’s out there as all? If so, how?)153

This course offers an introduction to philosophical debate in the Warring States period of ancient China. This was the Classical Age of Chinese Philosophy and the seedbed from which grew all of the native currents of thought that survived from traditional China. The course will look primarily at Confucius, Mozi, Yang Zhu, Mencius, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Xunzi and Hanfeizi, and consider their various and competing conceptions of the Dao—the way for the individual to best live his life or for the community to conduct its affairs. The approach of the course will be both historical and critical, and will attempt to both situate Classical Chinese philosophical discourse in its intellectual-historical context and to bring out its continuing relevance.Philip J.

In what way do we know about the minds of other people? How do we know what we are thinking? What are unconscious mental states? We will also consider some philosophical questions about specific kinds of mental states including wanting, believing, feeling pain, and loving.4

Some of the beliefs people have are more rational than others.  But which?
And why?  In this class we’ll explore these central epistemological
questions by discussing readings on three topics: Socrates’ claim that
no-one knowingly does wrong, the rationality of religious belief, and
skepticism.  The class is intended as an introduction to philosophy, so no
prior philosophical experience is necessary.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Klempner.
TuWTh 10-12:30,

Logic is about reasoning. People reason well or reason
poorly; peopleís arguments are good or bad. Logic is concerned with
telling the difference; specifically, we will look at formal systems for
characterizing and evaluating the structure of a particular kind of
argument, deductive arguments. A good, or valid, deductive argument is one
in which the conclusion follows from the premisesóone in which true
premises would guarantee a true conclusion. Our study of formal systems
will yield methods for figuring out when arguments are valid.This class is in many ways like a math class: the work will primarily
involve doing logic problems. It should, however, give you a greater
appreciation for the structure of arguments in ordinary English.25A

   about the kind of understanding of the world, human beings, and their
   place in it that some of the great philosophers of the period aspired to
   in light of the scientific developments of their time. In particular, we
   will focus on philosophical views about knowledge, thought, and self. We
   will begin by looking at some medieval thinkers, Avicenna and Aquinas,
   and continue on into the modern period proper with Descartes, Hobbes,

This course will compare and contrast the Greek, Medieval and Modern worlds as expressed in their greatest literature. We will follow in detail how in the West polytheism gradually became more and more monolithic until everything was understood in relation to a single God, and then how this synthesis fell apart and left our culture with a choice between nihilism or a return to polytheism.  The goal of the course is both to illustrate how to read difficult texts and to provide an understanding of the cultural paradigms that have formed and focused our shared beliefs and practices.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Fitelson.
MWF 12-1,

Logic is about reasoning, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and how to tell the difference between good and bad reasoning.In this course, we will develop techniques for laying bare the structure of arguments (“reasonings”). This will enable us then to characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These three things — a conception of structure of arguments, a precise characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning — constitute a “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a conclusion.Textbook: Modern Logic by Graeme Forbes, Oxford University Press, 1994.25A

In this course you will be introduced to philosophy by engaging with the
ideas and arguments of the three most important ancient Greek philosophers:
Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. They will help us consider how we should be
living our lives, what justice is, how we can acquire knowledge, what
knowledge is, what one gains from asking “what is it?” questions, what
change is, whether we can understand anything in the natural world, and a
host of other philosophical questions that were deeply influential on the
rest of western philosophy. Along the way, you’ll work on the following
skills: making and understanding arguments and objections, reading difficult
texts carefully, and writing clearly and precisely about philosophy. You
will be learning to do philosophy by engaging with its foundational works.100

Philosophy of Mind.

The single most important question in philosophy ? and in intellectual
life generally ? at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we
reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious,
free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human
beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical
particles?
This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the
nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused
by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How
do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is
the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free
will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our
free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves
as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How
exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of
social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments?
This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental
questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and

Theory of Meaning.
Campbell.
MWF 9-10,

This course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein. We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege and Russell. Prerequisite: two previous courses in philosophy.138

What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The
course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the
differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail? Are there human rights, and if so what are they and where do they come from?138 - Books  Hollis, M.         The Philosophy of Social Science    Cambridge 0521447801 R Searle, J.

The goal of this course is “logic literacy”.  Contemporary philosophy is steeped in logic: to read journal articles and take part in discussions, one needs to know a certain amount of logic. We will study i) the basic techniques of logic, including syntax, semantics, proof theory, metalogic, and a bit of philosophy of logic; and ii) a number of extensions of standard logic that are important in philosophy (for example, intuitionist logic, modal logic, counterfactuals). The course will be more broad than deep: we will examine many different systems, but will not spend a lot of time proving difficult metalogical results about these systems (except for completeness in propositional modal logic.178

We will be focusing particularly on Kant’s views on the following topics: a priori knowledge and how it is possible, space and time, objectivity and experience, self-knowledge, and the contrast between appearances and things in themselves.  Several short papers and two longer papers will be required.  Prerequisite: Philosophy 25BTexts:

“The Origin of the Work of Art” in the Context of Heidegger’s Later ThinkingIn this undergraduate seminar we will focus on Heidegger’s account of works of art as cultural paradigms, and his turn to Hölderlin as an exemplary poet who produces and preserves meaning in “destitute times”. This will also involve examining Heidegger’s complex views on technology and its role in our modern world.The essay collections Poetry, Language, Thought and Elucidations of Hölderlin’s Poetry by Martin Heidegger have been ordered for the course. A few additional texts will be made available later in a reader or on b-space.Enrollment is limited to 20 (by application only). Preference will be given to Philosophy majors or those who have already taken a course on Heidegger.To apply to enroll students should submit a brief statement (less than a page long) to the instructors via email (dreyfus@berkeley.edu and kuk@berkeley.edu) by May 27th, explaining their interest in this seminar and their background in philosophy. Those accepted will be notified and given a course enrollment code via email soon thereafter.200

Graduate Seminar: Aristotle’s Posterior Analytics.
Frede.
M 4-6,
121 Wheeler.
The Posterior Analytics builds on Aristotle’s logic as developed in the Prior Analytics by 
focusing on demonstrative proofs.  But Aristotle is here no longer concerned with the structure of proofs, rather than with the conditions of proof.  There is therefore little use made of the theory of the syllogism, instead Aristotle discusses the starting points of all sciences: 
definitions, existential assumptions, general axioms.  Thus the Posterior Analytics contains Aristotle’s philosophy of science because he is sorting out the different kinds of starting points and points out the various problems of ascertaining them.   Given the density and complexity of the text the seminar will not cover the entire work, but focus on what is most important about the Aristotelian conception of an exact science.  For readers of Greek there will be an extra hour of study of the Greek text.290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Kant’s ‘Critique of Judgment’.
Ginsborg.
M 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
The seminar will be concerned primarily with the part of the book dealing with Kant’s aesthetics, and more specifically his theory of the beautiful.  We’ll be trying to understand the theory in its own right, but also its connections to Kant’s broader epistemological project, and in particular to his theory of judgment as it applies in theoretical knowledge.  If time permits, and depending on the interests of the participants, we’ll also look at some of Kant’s theory of biological teleology.  The readings will primarily be drawn from the book itself, but we will also be reading extracts of Henry Allison’s 2001 book, “Kant’s Theory of Taste”, and some articles by the instructor.   We’ll be using the translation by Guyer and Matthews (Cambridge, 2000).   Participants should have some prior acquaintance with Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason”.290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Real Presence: Consciousness, Depiction, and Art.
Noë.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
The focus of this graduate seminar is the nature of depiction and the experience of pictures. What do you see when you look at a picture? What is a picture? And what makes some pictures works of art? Pictures introduce the problem of intentionality, so an underlying project of the seminar is to understand and explain intentionality. A further guiding concern is the value of art, and art criticism, for philosophy (as philosophy). We will also consider the question of dance (what do you see when you look at a dance?).290-4 
Graduate Seminar: Fallibility in science and the courtroom.
Roush.
W 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
Our belief-forming processes are fallible; even in our best epistemic states we still might be wrong. Fallibilism reassures us that our imperfect reliability doesn’t mean that any belief is as good as any other. Nevertheless, there are three areas of discussion where this point is not fully observed: the pessimistic induction over the history of science, worries about the use of fallible testimony and fallible jurors in the courtroom, and the debate over Intelligent Design “theory” in the public schools. This is because we do not fully understand how to take our fallibility into account. In this seminar, we discuss fallibilism and a proposal for a new rationality constraint, and apply these ideas to the debates above.290-5

Graduate Seminar: Decision Theory.
Buchak.
W 1-3,
234 Moses Hall.
What are the constraints on rational preferences?  This course will consider
various answers and approaches to this question within decision theory.
In decision theory, the question of what it is rational to prefer or decide
is tied up both with what it is rational to believe and with what it is
rational to desire.  The first section of the course will examine proposed
constraints on beliefs, desires, and preferences at a time by a single
individual.  We will examine standard decision theory and its axioms, as
well as various ways to argue for these axioms.  We will also examine
significant challenges to the theory.  The second section of the course will
consider constraints on preferences, beliefs, and desires across time,
including both forward-looking constraints, such as “reflection principles,”
and backwards-looking constraints, such as following through on commitments;
and related puzzles.  The third section of the course will consider
constraints across persons.  We will consider whether the existence of
disagreement - with a peer, or with one’s counterfactual self - should
compel a rational epistemic agent to change her beliefs.  Finally, we will
examine what, if any, relations there are among problems of decision making
across time, across persons, and across possible worlds.This course is intended for graduate students in philosophy; no background
in decision theory or formal epistemology is required.  One of my goals in
teaching this course is to introduce “newcomers” to the subject.  I will
simplify the technical material for easier accessibility, but students
wishing to go more in depth will have the opportunity.295

The Nature of Mind.
Campbell.
TuTh 2-3:30,
390 Hearst.
In this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.11 
Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion.
Buchak.
TuTh 9:30-11,
4 LeConte.
This course addresses basic questions in the philosophy of religion,
primarily from the Western philosophical tradition.  For example, does God
exist?  Should we believe in God?  Are there such things as souls, and if
so, how do they interact with the physical body?  How should a just God
punish us for our moral wrongdoing?  Finally, is morality based on God’s
commands?  The course material will be arranged topically, rather than
historically, and will be divided into four sections: arguments for and
against the existence of God, epistemology, metaphysics, and morality.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Warren.
MWF 1-2,
2060 Valley.
This course is intended to introduce the student to the concepts and principles of deductive logic: symbolizing English language sentences and arguments in terms of formalized languages; validity, implication, and equivalence in truth-functional and quantificational logic; systems of deduction, and their soundness and completeness. In addition to the three lectures, each student will attend two sections per week.Requirements: Lecture and section attendance, weekly problem sets, several in-section quizzes, a midterm and a final.Text: Warren Goldfarb’s /Deductive Logic/ , Hackett, 2003.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Ginsborg.
MWF 11-12,
10 Evans.
The course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics. We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.100

Contemporary Ethical Issues.

MWF 12-1,

This course will investigate the ethical dimensions of several issues in
social policy and individual conduct.  The questions we ask will likely
include the following.  Is abortion ever morally permissible?  Can
patriotism be morally justified?  What is racism, and what makes it wrong?
 Does thinking in terms of race even make sense?  Should we get rid of
racial thought and discourse?110 
Aesthetics.
Noë.
MWF 11-12,
213 Wheeler.
This course will explore topics in the philosophy of art.  What is  art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a  picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is  performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about  human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to  answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and  related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th  century).Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology  entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by  Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.This course is an upper division philosophy course. it is intended for  students with some background in philosophy. Students with knowledge  of the arts are welcome, space permitting, provided they are motivated  to do philosophy.115 
Political Philosophy.
Sluga.
TuTh 12:30-2,
160 Kroeber.
The course will examine some of the basic concepts of politics and specifically the concept of the political.  This concern is motivated by the thought that our traditional understanding of politics (going ultimately back to Plato and Aristotle) has come or is coming apart.  In the middle section of the course attention will be focused on the work of Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, and Michel Foucault and their attempts to re-conceptualize the field of politics.  The final third of the course will consider how questions concerning technology, terrorism, globalization, and the environment affect the way we need to think about politics.125 
Metaphysics.
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,
50 Birge.
A wide-ranging lecture-and-discussion course on the nature and prospects of metaphysics as the investigation of the necessary conditions of the possibility of thought and experience.  Can some such conditions be discovered, and can metaphysical conclusions about reality be drawn from them?  Particular topics to be explored in this way include: the problem of metaphysics; the project of Kantian or “transcendental” metaphysics; the independent reality of the colors of objects; the independent reality of causation; agency and the independent reality of values; the prospects of metaphysical satisfaction.
Familiarity with the history of modern philosophy, especially the philosophy of Hume and of Kant, is strongly recommended.  Required course work includes extensive reading of sometimes difficult abstract material and careful, accurate writing of focussed critical papers.Not for beginners in philosophy.Reading: Philosophy 125 Reader (available at Copy Central)

Philosophy of Science.
Roush.
TuTh 2-3:30,
210 Wheeler.
This is a course in general philosophy of science. We study five topics of central importance where formal probabilistic approaches have brought progress. We ask: What makes something a scientific explanation?, What is required for observations to confirm (support) a hypothesis?, Is simplicity a guide to truth?, What is special about predicting novel data as opposed to accommodation of old data?, and Does the success of science give us reason to believe its theories are true? Topics covered include the problem of induction, some paradoxes of confirmation, and the advantages and disadvantages of Bayesianism. Prerequisite: one course in philosophy.141 
Philosophy & Game Theory.
Buchak.
TuTh 2-3:30,
174 Barrows.
This course deals with applications of game theory and rational choice
theory to philosophical problems, as well as with paradoxes and problems
introduced by these theories.  After introducing the basic concepts of game
theory, the first part of the course will be devoted to problems of
cooperation and convention: how people manage to coordinate their actions
for mutual benefit, e.g. drive on the same side of the road, carry out a
project together, or use language.  The next section will explore
non-cooperative games, such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma; the possible
application of these games to moral problems; and the need for and execution
of a social contract.  Finally, we turn to problems dealing with groups,
such as the problem of collective action, and some issues in group decision
making.160 
Plato.
Frede.
TuTh 12:30-2,
210 Wheeler.
This course will study the development of Plato’s theory of Forms from its first traces in some earlier dialogues to its explanation his middle years and possible revisions in his work.  The examination will also include questions of the development in Plato’s theory of knowledge and the methods he uses in the discussion of the theory of Forms.  The focus will be on the central passages for this topic in Plato’s Euthyphro, Meno, Phaedo, Republic, Symposium, Phaedrus, Parmenides, Sophist and the Philebus.Required:

Alanen.
MWF 2-3,

In this course we will make a close study of  Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy, aiming to understand his new conception of the nature of the human mind and its relation to the world.  We will consider his use of skepticism and the arguments for overcoming it.  We will study his account of ideas and their objects that formed the starting point for subsequent theories of mind and knowledge.  Special attention will be given, on the one hand,  to his argument that the nature of mind is wholly distinct from that of body, and, on the other, to his account of the human being as a real union of an autonomous thinking self and an extended mechanistically moving body. We will reflect on the tensions in Descartes’s dualism and various ways of addressing them. We will also look at the context of the Meditations, reading excerpts from other texts, e.g.,The  Objections and Replies, The Principles of Philosophy, The Passions of the Soul, and selections in a Course Reader.

Graduate Seminar: Causation in Psychology.
Campbell.
W 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
There will be three components to the seminar:  (1)  The nature of causation and the idea of a ‘level’ of explanation.  Here we will look in particular at the interventionist model of causation advocated by, among others, Woodward and Hitchcock.  (2)  Causation as it applies to mental states.  In particular, we will consider the analysis of perception, and whether it makes a difference to the causal role of perception that perceptual states are often conscious.  This will mean looking at various models of the content of conscious perception.  (3)  The role of rationality in an analysis of mental causation.  Here we will look at mental causation in psychiatry, and whether there is a place for an assumption of rationality in cases of, for example, delusion.  We will also look at the view of thinking as a motor process.290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Plato’s Phaedo.
Ebrey.
M 4-6,
233 Dwinelle.
In this course, we will work our way through Plato’s Phaedo, covering most
topics in it and trying to get an overall understanding of the dialogue.
Although only around 60 pages long, the Phaedo covers an incredibly wide
range of topics. If Plato’s Meno looks like his first transition from
ethical topics to epistemological ones, the Phaedo looks like his first
transition from ethical topics to metaphysical ones: the nature of
opposites, change, the forms, the sensible world, souls, and causation. The
dialogue is framed by ethical questions which are sometimes given
short-shrift in the secondary literature, but which I want us to discuss:
should we fear death? Is it acceptable to commit suicide? Are our body and
soul somehow at odds with one another? These ethical questions are connected
to the metaphysical and epistemological issues through the main topic of the
dialogue: four arguments for the immortality of the soul. In addition to the
topics already mentioned, Plato develops the idea that all learning is
recollection, which he had introduced in the Meno, and he provides a long
myth at the end of the dialogue, which provides an overall cosmological
picture of the universe.In addition to reading the Phaedo very closely, we will be reading secondary
literature, parts of other relevant dialogues, and other ancient
philosophers (particularly Anaxagoras, who seems to have a very strong
influence on the Phaedo).If you have not read any Plato before this class, I strongly suggest reading
the Euthyphro (one of Plato’s earlier, Socratic works) before the course
begins. I also strongly encourage you to read through the entire Phaedo once
before the course begins.290-3

Graduate Seminar:  Assessment Sensitivity.
MacFarlane.
Tu 6-8,
234 Moses Hall.
In this seminar we will investigate how we might make sense of the
idea that truth is relative, and how we might use this idea to give
satisfying accounts of parts of our thought and talk that have
resisted traditional methods of analysis. Although there is a
substantial philosophical literature on relativism about truth,
this literature (both pro and con) has tended to focus on refutations
of the doctrine, or refutations of these refutations, at the expense of
saying clearly what the doctrine is. The approach here will be to try
to give a clear account of the view, and then to use the view to solve
some problems that have concerned philosophers and semanticists. The
main aim is to put relativist solutions to these problems on the table,
so that they may be compared with non-relativist solutions and accepted
or rejected on their merits.The main text of the seminar will be a book manuscript I am working
on, entitled
Assessment Sensitivity: Relative Truth and Its Applications. We
will tentatively aim to get through about one chapter each week,
with the aim of covering much, though not all, of the book. (Some
chapters still need to be written!) Each week there will also be
quite a bit of supplemental reading by other philosophers.The book falls into three main parts, and so will the seminar. In
the first part, we will consider how a relativist view might be
motivated, by reviewing the difficulties faced by various
non-relativist views about the meanings of words like “tasty.” We
will also survey some of the standard objections to relativism
about truth, with a view to clarifying a relativist’s philosophical
obligations. In the second part, we will attempt to give a clear
statement of the truth relativist position and try to make some
philosophical sense of it. In the third part, we will consider how
the machinery developed in the second part can be applied to some
real problems in semantics and philosophy (involving future
contingents, knowledge attributions, epistemic and deontic modals,
and indicative conditionals). If time permits, we may also consider
how the view I am developing compares with other views in the
vicinity.This seminar is intended primarily for Berkeley graduate students
in philosophy and in logic and the methodology of science. Others
should seek my permission before enrolling in the course.
A background in
philosophy of language, with some exposure to truth-conditional
semantics, will be helpful, though I will try to make the seminar
as accessible as possible to those who need to catch up in this
area.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: Consciousness, Language and Social Ontology.
Searle.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
This seminar will cover a variety of topics under the general headings in its title. I want to begin by looking at the problem of disjunctivism and we will start with Tyler Burge’s article on the subject. When we finish with disjunctivism, I want to reexamine the issue of collective intentionality in light of some recent criticisms of my views on the subject. These discussion will then lead in one of or both of two directions: one about perception and one about language. Right now I do not have in focus what exactly I want to cover, but these are the general directions in which I am moving. 290-6 
Graduate Seminar: Perceptual Knowledge.
Stroud.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
An investigation not of perception or of knowledge in general but of the nature and “proper objects” of perception understood as a source of knowledge.  The main idea to be explored is that our knowing things about the world around us by perception can be satisfactorily explained only if we can be understood to sometimes perceive that such-and-such is so, where what we perceive to be so is the very state of the world that we thereby know to be so.  Central to the possibility of perceptual knowledge understood in this way is the distinction between perceiving an object x and perceiving that p.  The goal of the seminar is a better understanding of the conditions of this ‘propositional’ perception and its implications for a satisfactory explanation of perceptual knowledge of the world. Readings will be drawn from recent works of Brewer, Burge, Campbell, Cassam, Dretske, McDowell, and others.  I do not now have a fixed syllabus in mind.  I envisage broad-ranging, open-ended discussions of these issues and of whatever related lines of thought are of most interest to the participants.  Those in attendance will be expected to participate.  If you have in mind specific readings you would like the seminar to discuss, or if you would like to present something of your own within this range of questions, please let me know.290-7 
Graduate Seminar: Valuing (Future) Persons.
Wallace.
M 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
It is a common thought that persons are profoundly valuable, and that their inherent value is an important desideratum for morality (perhaps the important desideratum).  But what exactly is it to ascribe value to persons?  How, more specifically, should the acknowledgement of the value of a person constrain or shape our deliberations about actions that might affect the person’s life in some way?  This seminar will examine some recent work in moral philosophy that centers on these issues, paying attention in particular to questions about our attitudes toward persons who do not (yet) exist.  Readings will include texts by Derek Parfit, T. M. Scanlon, Seana Shiffrin, David Velleman, and others.290-8 
Graduate Seminar: Representations, Consciousness, and Self-consciousness in Some Early Modern Philosophers.
Warren.
F 3-5,
234 Moses Hall.
We will look at the views of a number of philosophers, especially Kant, on the question of what consciousness or self-consciousness adds to representations. Other philosophers we will examine are Descartes, Arnauld, Malebranche, Locke, and Leibniz. We will focus on the clarity and distinctness of a representation, and we will consider how they relate to conceptualization and judgment, and to self-consciousness. This will put us in a position to better understand Kant’s idea that the unity of consciousness makes possible the unity of a complex representation.295

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Berkey.
MTuWTh 12-2,
215 Dwinelle.
This course is an introduction to moral and political philosophy.  Rather
than treating these as largely distinct areas of inquiry that answer
fundamentally different questions, we will approach questions in this
course in part by considering how our answers to some questions might
impact our answers to others.  After beginning by looking at several views
about the nature of morality, we will examine various positions on the
extent to which morality can make demands on individuals, including
thinking about how morality?s demands might be limited by considerations
of fairness, integrity, and the importance of personal projects.  We will
then consider two prominent views of justice, defended by Rawls and Nozick
respectively, and look at how each argues against the view of justice
defended by the other.  We will conclude by examining the ways in which
principles of justice and the demands of morality on individuals might
intersect, and the ways in which our intuitions about different questions
might lead us to hold views that are incompatible.  Attempting to resolve
this conflict and other similar conflicts will be a major theme of the
course.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Schnee.
MTuWTh 10-12,
130 Wheeler.
This course is an introduction to the philosophical study of the mind.  What is the mind?  Are our mental states, like beliefs and desires, states of our brains?  Are they states of some non-physical substance?  Or are they nothing more than tendencies to behave in certain ways?  Could a computer have a mind?  What is consciousness?  Is the nature of our conscious experiences entirely determined by our brain states?  Why is the study of consciousness so difficult?  Can there be a ?science? of consciousness?  When you have a belief about the President, what makes it the case that your belief is about that particular person?  Philosophers have argued for a variety of answers to these questions.  We will examine and evaluate those answers and arguments, and attempt to gain an understanding of the relation between the physical world and our minds.  12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Rieppel.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
174 Barrows.
What is it for an argument to be deductively valid? Intuitively, what’s
required is that the conclusion “follow from” the premises, or that the
truth of the premises “guarantee” the truth of the conclusion.  In this
course we will look at how to make this intuitive notion of validity
more precise.  We will learn how to represent the logical form of
English arguments in increasingly more fine-grained ways, and how to use
semantic and syntactic methods to demonstrate the validity of arguments
given such formal representations.  Upon completing the course, students
can expect to be familiar with the basic concepts of symbolic logic and
to be in a better position to formulate and evaluate arguments in
natural languages like English.Textbook: Modern Logic by Graeme Forbes, Oxford University Press, 1994.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Stazicker.
MTuWTh 10-12,
215 Dwinelle.
This intensive 6-week course is an introduction to the philosophy of
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, as well as an introduction to doing
philosophy.  Our aim will be to understand the views and arguments of
these philosophers, and to engage critically with them.  This will require
close reading of the ancient texts, and thoughtful discussion of the
issues they raise.  Some of the ideas we discuss will be surprisingly
familiar, some of them strikingly alien to our usual ways of thinking.  In
studying and assessing these ideas, we will be asking not only what, if
anything, justifies the ancient philosophers’ views, but also what, if
anything, justifies our own views.
The questions we will discuss include: What is the difference between
knowledge and belief?  What are definitions?  Must someone who understands
a notion be able to define it?  What is the connection between virtue and
knowledge?  How is it possible to be weak willed?  Is breaking the law
ever morally justifiable?  What is the connection between morality and
being human?
Students will be required to write three short papers, contribute to
in-class discussion, and sit a final exam.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Parrott.
MTuWTh 12-2,
156 Dwinelle.
Philosophy during the 17th and 18th centuries was shaped largely in
response to revolutionary new developments in the natural sciences–the
so-called Scientific Revolution.   The aim of this course is to give an
introductory survey to some of the most important philosophical writings
from this modern period.   We will read texts by Descartes, Locke,
Berkeley, Leibniz, Hume and Kant.  The philosophical topics to be covered
include the nature of reality, the existence of God, the relation between
mind and body, and the possibility of knowing anything about the world
around us.  The views offered by the philosophers we will be studying have
strongly influenced all philosophical thinking to come after this period. Thus, in addition, to learning about the historical context of these
works, we will also be critically engaging and assessing the plausibility
of the philosophical arguments in their own right.153 
Chinese Philosophy.
Loy.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
223 Dwinelle.
This course offers an introduction to philosophical debate in the Warring States period of ancient China, the Classical Age of Chinese Philosophy and the seedbed from which grew all of the native currents of thought that survived from traditional China. We will focus on the competing conceptions of the Dao—the way for the individual to best live his life or for the community to conduct its affairs—associated with Confucius, Mozi, Yang Zhu, Mencius, Laozi, Zhuangzi and Xunzi. The approach of the course will be both historical and critical, and will attempt to both situate Classical Chinese philosophical discourse in its intellectual-historical context and to bring out its continuing relevance.Philip J.

Kant.
Ginsborg.
TuWTh 2-4:30,

We will discuss central themes in Kant’s metaphysics and epistemology, focussing mainly on the first half of the Critique of Pure Reason. Prerequisite: Philosophy 25B (History of Modern Philosophy) or equivalent.188 
Phenomenology.
Moural.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
155 Barrows.
Phenomenology was – besides analytic philosophy – one of the two great philosophical movements of the 20th century. It has been praised for addressing topics more relevant to real people’s life, but blamed for relatively lower standards of clarity and for non-delivering its over-ambitious goals. It has been more influential than analytic philosophy outside of academic philosophy (and is thus important in many areas of humanities and cultural studies). Within philosophy, there have been repeated attempts to merge life-relevance of phenomenology with clarity and modesty of analysis.In this course, we shall focus on close reading and critical explanation of selections from three classical books of the movement, Edmund Husserl’s Cartesian Meditations (1929) and Crisis of European Sciences (1936) and Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception (1945). The Cartesian Meditations are the best introduction to Husserl’s phenomenology, in the Crisis he adds influential material about the life-world, about science, and about history. In the Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty merges motives from Husserl and Heidegger with stuff from psychology and psychopathology and sketches his own conception of philosophy.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California2 
Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Engen.
MTuWTh 10-12,
156 Dwinelle.
This course serves as an introduction to philosophy through a number of
central issues in moral philosophy.  We will consider whether moral claims
are objectively true in the sense that individual people can be mistaken
about what is morally right and wrong.  We will also analyze a few
prominent views of what makes actions right and wrong.  In light of these
views, we will take up some questions in political philosophy, such as
whether the state is justified in punishing its citizens and how resources
should be distributed in society.  Readings for the course will be drawn
from both classic and contemporary sources.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Bezsylko.
MTuWTh 2-4,
209 Dwinelle.
The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to philosophy
 by doing philosophy of mind. We will begin by taking up the
 traditional question: What kind of thing is the mind? In connection
 with this question, we will engage with philosophers who think of the
 contents of the mind, things such as ideas, perceptions, beliefs,
 dreams, and imaginings, as something like pictures. We will focus on
 dreams in particular. From there, we will move on to an enormous
 question in the philosophy of mind which brings together a number of
 fascinating issues: Are human beings free? And if so, to what extent
 are they free and in what areas of our mental life does our freedom
 lie? In connection with this question, we will look at some writings
 in psychoanalysis and spend some time thinking about one particularly
 important domain of our freedom, namely: love. Throughout the course,
 we will learn how to read, think, speak, and write critically and with
 great precision and rigor.4 
Knowledge & Its Limits.
Chen.
MTuWTh 12-2,
223 Dwinelle.
We will begin this introductory course in epistemology with the question
of whether we really know what we ordinarily think we know, and the
worrisome view that we really do not: skepticism. We will focus in this
regard on the following questions. The skeptic seems to demand from us
some kind of explanation of how we know the things we think we know. What
kind of demand is this and how does the skeptic raise it? Is it a
reasonable demand – must we meet it? And even if we don’t need to, how
does one say what is so compelling about such a demand? We may also touch
on further, but related questions about the relation between belief,
truth, and justification, and about how we ought to go about believing
things.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Beattie.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
136 Barrows.
This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and techniques of deductive logic.  Students will learn how to symbolize English-language sentences precisely and then use formal methods to establish key relations between them (e.g. one sentence implying another or being equivalent to another).  This will permit us to demonstrate that certain arguments or inferences are good ones, in the sense that the truth of their assumptions or premises would guarantee the truth of their conclusions.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Gelber.
MTuWTh 12-2,
229 Dwinelle.
This course is an introduction to some of the main figures and problems in Ancient Greek Philosophy. We will read texts spanning from the Pre-Socratic through Hellenistic philosophers, but the majority of our attention will be given to Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. Our goal will be to understand not only what the views these thinkers held were, but why they held them and how they argued for them.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Schwenkler.
MTuWTh 2-4,
156 Dwinelle.
An examination of central issues in early modern philosophy by way
   of texts by Rene Descartes, John Locke, Julien Offray de La Mettrie,
   George Berkeley, David Hume, Thomas Reid, and (very briefly)
   Immanuel Kant. Topics covered will include: skepticism and
   knowledge; matter and the soul; perception, thought, and personal
   identity; and the nature of moral judgment. Of particular interest
   will be the rise of philosophical naturalism, and the question of
   how the modern scientific understanding of nature impacts
   philosophers’ treatments of the above subjects.107 
Moral Psychology.
Flanagan.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
180 Tan.
Do humans possess an innate moral faculty that evolved to meet certain adaptive challenges? Is the innate equipment a single faculty or does the moral mind consist of several distinct modules, e.g., one for compassion, one for justice, and so on?   Is the moral mind well-designed to meet the adaptive challenges modern people face? We will examine two distinct literatures to answer this question: (1) comparative work in philosophical anthropology, examining Greek, Chinese, Buddhist ethics; (2) recent work at the intersection of moral philosophy, psychology, and evolutionary biology.Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics (Hackett)

Hume.
Moural.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
136 Barrows.
The focus of the course is on David Hume’s (1711-1776) epistemology, metaphysics, and metaphilosophy (arguably the core of his philosophical project). We shall examine the relation between the early and the mature version of his views, studying closely A Treatise of Human Nature, book I (1739), An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748) and the transitional texts.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California3 
Nature of Mind.
Lee.
MWF 9-10,
145 Dwinelle.
This course will be an introduction to some of the major debates in Philosophy of Mind. Is consciousness a purely physical phenomenon? Is the brain a computer and the mind its software? Are our common-sense ideas about how to explain people’s behavior compatible with contemporary scientific views about the structure of the brain? How can the mind represent the external world?7 
Existentialism in Literature&Film.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 3:30-5,
145 Dwinelle.
The course will be organized around various attempts to reinterpret the
Judeo/Christian God, and to determine in what sense, if at all, such a God
is still a living God.  We will study Dostoyevsky?s and Kierkegaard’s
attempts to preserve a non-theological version of the God of Christianity,
as well as Nietzsche?s attempt to save us from belief in any version of
God offered by our tradition.  We will view and discuss three films that
deal with related issues12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Mancosu.
MWF 9-10,
105 Northgate.
The course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicates the intuitive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’) and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’). In addition, we will also develop techniques for showing when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus. Textbook: J. Barwise, J. Etchemendy, “Language, Proof and Logic”, latest edition. (The book comes with a CD. Do not buy the book used! If you do, you will not be able to submit your exercises on line, which you will be required to.)24 
Freshman Seminar: The Ethics of Food: Philosophical Perspectives on “The Omnivore’s Dilemma”.
Wallace.
W 12-1,
234 Moses Hall.
We will discuss “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” by Michael Pollan, and also look at some philosophical literature that touches on the issues he raises in the book. Questions to be discussed include our responsibilities as consumers of food, the moral standing of animals, and the relation between individual and collective (political) agency. This seminar is part of the On the Same Page initiative: http://onthesamepage.berkeley.edu.24-2 
Hume’s “Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion”.
Warren.
W 4-5:30,
111 Kroeber Hall.
We will read and discuss this important work by the British philosopher, David Hume (1711-1776), which critically considers some of the most common arguments for the existence of God. Enrollment is by instructor approval only. Students will need to email the instructor at dmwarren@berkeley.edu to request permission to enroll in this seminar.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
MacFarlane.
MWF 10-11,
10 Evans.
This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy—and, for
the uninitiated, to philosophy itself. We will spend almost all of
our time on the three most important Greek philosophers—Socrates,
Plato, and Aristotle—with a passing glance at pre-Socratic and
Hellenistic philosophers. Our primary goal will be to understand these
philosophers’ characteristic methods and views, and (more importantly)
their reasons for holding these views. It is often said that we should
study ancient Greek philosophy because it is the intellectual basis
for all later western philosophy and natural science. That is true,
but it is only half the story. We should also study ancient Greek
philosophy to become familiar with a worldview so alien that it throws
our own into sharp relief. As you are outraged by some of the things
these philosophers say, you will come to see more clearly what your
own views are, and you will be forced to ask what justifies them. You
will not just be studying the history of philosophy; you will be doing
philosophy. Prerequisite: None.100 
Philosophical Methods.
Yalcin.
Th 2-4,
110  Barrows.
This course is restricted to philosophy majors. Its focus is on developing strength in philosophical writing. Students will meet regularly in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading and improve their written work. This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the nature of reason and rationality, beginning with some recent work on relativism and constructivism. Note: Enrollment priority may be given to senior philosophy majors.104 
Ethical Theories.
Wallace.
MWF 11-12,
101 Barker.
This course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy.  We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as some influential work by contemporary philosophers (including Korsgaard, Nagel, Scanlon, and Williams).  Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)?  Why should we care about complying with moral demands?  What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)?  115

Theory of Knowledge.
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,
213 Wheeler.
An upper-division course on the philosophical theory of knowledge.  Not a general, encyclopedic survey of the field, but an investigation and detailed discussion some of the central problems in the subject.  Knowledge of many different kinds is obviously fundamental to scientific, cultural, social, and personal life.  What is it about human perception, belief, and knowledge that makes it so difficult to find a philosophically satisfying general explanation of how human knowledge is possible?  And how are those obstacles to be overcome?We will spend about equal time on each of the three problems:How do we come to believe and know things that we do not 
        perceive to be so at the moment (e.g., the future)?What exactly do we perceive, and how does it give us 
        knowledge of the world around us at the moment?How does one person come to believe and know anything
        about what another person thinks and feels?Lectures and discussion sections will pursue these questions through close reading of assigned material in:
    Philosophy 122 Reader (available at Copy Central)
    Barry Stroud, The Significance of Philosophical ScepticismThere will be two lecture-discussion classes and a mandatory discussion section each week.In addition to discussion-section requirements as assigned by the Graduate Student Instructors, students will be expected to write three five-page papers throughout the semester, one on each of the three questions. Possible paper topics will be suggested in each case. 125 
Metaphysics.
Yalcin.
MWF 2-3,
213 Wheeler.
An advanced introduction to contemporary metaphysics, focusing on the ideas of objectivity, existence, naturalness, identity, time, causation, and possibility.133 
Philosophy of Language.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
50 Birge.
The main purpose of this course is to answer 
the question, “How does language relate to the world?” In order to do this we will have to explore a lot of related questions, such as those concerning the nature of truth, reference, meaning, speech acts, metaphors, fiction, and pictures. We will also try to develop a general theoretical account of how human linguistic behavior is related to the rest of human behavior 
and to human mental states.There are two parts to the course. In the first part, I will explain how I think language ought to be studied philosophically. The philosophy of language is a branch 
of the philosophy of mind. In the second part of the course, I will teach mainstream philosophy of language, and attempt both to explain and criticize it.135

Philosophy of Society.
Searle.
TuTh 2-3:30,
126 Barrows Hall.
How does human society differ from that of other social animals? How is it possible that there can be an objective reality of such things as money, property, government, marriage, and universities, even though such things exist only because we believe they exist? What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail? Are there human rights, and if so what are they and where do they come from?178 
Kant.

TuTh 2-3:30,

Heidegger.
Frede/Kaiser.
TuTh 11-12:30,
110 Wheeler Hall.
Since its publication in 1927 Heidegger’s major work Being and Time has been many things to its various recipients.  Though the work has made major contributions to existential thought, hermeneutics, and post-structuralism its main concern is a revolution of what Heidegger regarded as the central term of philosophy since antiquity: the concept of being.  Because he viewed the traditional understanding of this concept as superficial and misguided, his plan was to work out a new fundamental ontology. Its design was (I) to reveal the true meaning of being on the basis of temporality as its transcendental horizon and (II) to point out the crucial missteps in the tradition (Aristotle, Descartes and Kant) that led to the misconception.  Heidegger never finished this ambitious project, but the work’s first part with its extensive analysis of human understanding as the basis of the conception of being was sufficient to make this work a major challenge to friend and foe alike.  The course will focus on the connection between the question of being, the analysis of human nature, and the phenomenological method that Heidegger presents as the necessary foundations of his project in Division I of Being and Time.
We will largely confine ourselves to the study of the difficult text itself (we will use the 1962 translation by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson, available as a paperback reprint of 2008 in the Harper Perennial Modern Thought series) but a reader with some additional material and secondary literature will also be prepared.  Participants are required to give one class presentation and to submit a research-paper of 15 pages at the end of the semester.The course will be taught in a seminar format. Enrollment is limited to 25 and is by application only. Although the seminar is open to graduate students preference will be given to junior and senior philosophy majors. To apply to enroll students should write to the instructors (dfrede@berkeley.edu and kuk@berkeley.edu) by May 24th and very briefly describe their background in philosophy and their interest in the course. Those accepted will be notified and given a course enrollment code via email by the end of June.187 
Special Topics in the History of Philosophy: Kant’s Aesthetics.
Ginsborg.
Tu 2-5,
2519 Tolman.
We will discuss Kant’s aesthetic theory, focussing primarily on his theory of the beautiful.  We will be concerned both with the theory in its own right, and with its broader philosophical implications.  Readings will be drawn mostly from the Critique of Judgment, with some background material (e.g. Hume) and some secondary readings.  The class will be conducted as a seminar, and participants will be required to participate actively in discussion.  Requirements will include several short writing assignments and a longer final paper.Enrollment in the class is limited to 15 and is by application only.  To apply to enroll, you should send an email  (with “Philosophy 187 application” in the subject line) to the instructor at ginsborg@berkeley.edu with a description of your reasons for wishing to take the course and a description of your background in philosophy, including, but not necessarily limited to, a list of philosophy courses already taken.  Participants will be expected to have a strong background in philosophy, preferably including a course on Kant (although this is not essential).  Preference will be given to philosophy majors.  The deadline is Friday May 24.  If you are accepted you will receive a course enrollment code by email soon thereafter. 200 
First-Year Graduate Seminar.

290-1 
Graduate Seminar: Conceptual Representation.
Ginsborg/Lombrozo.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
This seminar, co-taught with Tania Lombrozo (Psychology), will explore theoretical and empirical issues in the study of conceptual representation. In particular, we will consider contemporary work from philosophy and psychology, addressing issues such as: How are conceptual representations structured? How do they refer to the world? And how are they acquired? The seminar will be co-taught by a philosopher and a psychologist (and cross-listed in both departments), so the approach will be interdisciplinary and students are encouraged to have an interest and some background in both psychology and philosophy. Requirements will include active participation in class discussions as well as a final paper.290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Attention, Consciousness and Mental Causation.
Campbell.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
We will start out by looking at joint attention and its role in linguistic communication.  Then we’ll move on to the phenomenon of attention itself and its relation to consciousness.  Finally, we’ll explicitly consider what kind of causal analysis to give of perceptual experience, given the roles that attention and consciousness play in perception.290-3 
Proof Theory.
Mancosu.
M 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
The seminar will cover in detail some basic results in proof theory.
We  will use the original articles by Gerhard Gentzen (1909-1945), who
 founded both structural proof theory and ordinal proof theory. This
is  timely as this year many conferences have been organized to
celebrate  the centenary of Gentzen’s birth. In structural proof
theory we will  cover, among other things, the natural deduction
calculus, the sequent  calculus, cut-elimination and mid-sequent
theorem for the sequent  calculus, and various applications of such
results. In ordinal proof  theory we will study, among other things,
Gentzen’s consistency proof  for first-order Peano Arithmetic using
ordinal induction up to  epsilon-zero. In addition, we will also read
some other logical and  philosophical articles by Gentzen and some
secondary literature, where  appropriate. The seminar will be of
interest to philosophers, logicians,  computer scientists, linguists
and mathematicians. Through this  material, philosophy students will
acquire the tools required for  tackling further debates in philosophy
of mathematics (prospects for  Hilbert’s program and its relativized
versions etc.) and philosophy of  logic and language (meaning of the
logical constants; proof-theoretic  semantics; realism/anti-realism,
Dummett’s program (normalization,  harmony etc.)). Graduate students
in philosophy may use this course,  with previous agreement by the
head graduate adviser and myself, for  satisfying the formal
philosophy course requirement (i.e. a course in  the 140 series or
equivalent).The minimal requirement for taking the seminar is Philosophy 12A
(Introduction to Logic), although a certain amount of
logical/mathematical maturity (but no specific knowledge of advanced
mathematics) will be necessary for mastering the material.290-4 
Graduate Seminar: Content & Consciousness.
Martin.
W 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
What is the connection between consciousness, and more specifically sensory consciousness and the idea of mental content? “Content of consciousness” is a phrase often used in a manner which contrasts with “propositional/representational/mental content”. But some people have argued that it is obvious that states of mind which exemplify sensory consciousness have content in the second sense, and that one cannot suppose that there is any content of consciousness in the first sense without accepting that sensory states have such content in the second sense. In these seminars I want to start out by looking at some recent arguments for the centrality of propositional content in sense experience. But the aim is not to settle the question whether perceptual experiences have (propositional) content but to try and formulate the best terms in which anything might turn on this. In this context I want to look first at some slightly older discussions of representation and sense-data and then move back to the beginning of the twentieth century to look at some of Moore’s writings on sensory awareness, sense-data and our knowledge of the external world.Requirements:Students taking this course for credit will write a term paper due no later than one week after the last day of class.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: Contractualism and its Critics.
Munoz-Dardé.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
This seminar will be organized around contractualist approaches in
contemporary political philosophy. The seminar will pursue three key
themes. First, authority: Is the principal concern of political theory
the authority of the state and the source of our obligations to obey
state institutions and its agents? If not, what should our principal
concerns in political philosophy be? Second, the weight of numbers:
Aren’t aggregative concerns intuitively compelling in certain social
policy contexts? Does that show that we must move beyond a pure
individualistic perspective to one in which consequential outcomes are
part of the measure of justice? Third, equality: Is equality or fairness
a political value in itself? In what sense can a position claim to be
egalitarian or guided by equality if it denies that equality has a
special value?In pursuing these questions we will consider writings by T. M. Scanlon,
John Rawls, Joseph Raz and G. A. Cohen, as well as some historical
texts. I will also distribute parts of the manuscript of a book I am
working on.290-6 
Graduate Seminar: Art and Human Nature.
Noë.
W 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
The topic of this seminar is art and human nature. What is art? Why do we value art as we do? What does art reveal about our nature? Drawing on philosophy, art history, and cognitive science, we will explore these questions. We will also look at recent efforts to frame problems about art in terms of neuroscience and evolutionary biology. Not only the pictorial but also the performing arts will concern us. This seminar is open to graduate students of philosophy. All other students require the permission of the instructor to attend.295

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Kolodny.
MWF 3-4,
2060 Valley.
We will survey the basic questions of moral and political philosophy, as well as some classic attempts to answer them.  We will ask, among other things: What is the morally right thing for me to do?  Why should I do it?  Is there a fact of the matter what it is, or does it just depend on my feelings or upbringing?  Why should I do what the government tells me to?  Why should I tolerate alien moral beliefs and practices?  We may read, among others: Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Bentham, Mill, and Nietzsche.3 
Nature of Mind.
Campbell.
TuTh 2-3:30,
2060 Valley.
In this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of  psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical  world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism,  Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism,  Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the  mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and  hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they  configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental  states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to  the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states  of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its  potential for causal relations with other mental states and with  behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the  brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary  biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in  biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the  world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the  course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.11 
Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion.
Buchak.
MWF 1-2,
2 LeConte.
This course addresses basic questions in the philosophy of religion,
primarily from the Western philosophical tradition.  For example, does God
exist?  Should we believe in God?  Are there such things as souls, and if
so, how do they interact with the physical body?  How should a just God
punish us for our moral wrongdoing?  Is morality based on God’s commands?
The course will deal primarily with contemporary readings, and material will
be arranged topically, rather than historically.  The course is divided into
four sections: arguments for and against the existence of God, epistemology,
metaphysics, and morality.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Fitelson.
TuTh 12:30-2,
A1 Hearst Annex.
Logic is about reasoning, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and how to tell the difference between good and bad reasoning.In this course, we will develop techniques for laying bare the structure of arguments (“reasonings”). This will enable us then to characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These three things — a conception of structure of arguments, a precise characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning — constitute a “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a conclusion.25B

Special Topics in Political Philosophy.
Kolodny.
MWF 2-3,
200 Wheeler.
This course will survey recent discussions of all or some of the following topics in political philosophy: affirmative action, abortion, free speech, toleration, multiculturalism, punishment, war, terrorism, taxation, money in politics, and democratic authority (that is, why, if at all, we should go along with the majority).As taught this semester, Phil 116 satisfies the ethics requirement  for the philosophy major.125 
Metaphysics.
Lee.
TuTh 12:30-2,
20 Barrows Hall.
This course will be a survey of some ongoing debates in metaphysics.
Questions we will consider will include: Why does the universe exist? Is
time’s passage an illusion? Is space a container and the world its
contents? What is it for an object to exist at more than one time? Do other
possible worlds exist?128 
Philosophy of Science.
Roush.
MWF 3-4,
220 Wheeler Hall.
This is a course in general philosophy of science. We study five topics of central importance where formal probabilistic approaches have brought progress. We ask: What makes something a scientific explanation?, What is required for observations to confirm (support) a hypothesis?, Is simplicity a guide to truth?, What is special about predicting novel data as opposed to accommodation of old data?, and Does the success of science give us reason to believe its theories are true? Topics covered include the problem of induction, some paradoxes of confirmation, and the advantages and disadvantages of Bayesianism. Prerequisite: one course in philosophy.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
141 McCone/50 Birge starting 1/28.
The single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments? This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.140A 
Intermediate Logic.
Warren.
MWF 12-1,
100 Wheeler.
This course has two parts. Part One will be more technical in nature. It will involve learning some of the key metalogical results for first-order logic (e.g., soundness, completeness, and compactness). The goal will be to get through Parts 1–3 of Hunter’s “Metalogic” textbook, which concludes with a famous metalogical paradox called “Skolem’s Paradox”. Part Two will be more philosophical in nature. It will involve investigating the historical impact (on 20th century analytic philosophy) of the metalogical results covered in Part One of the course. For instance, we will discuss the influence of “Skolem’s Paradox” on the philosophical development of W.V.O. Quine and Hilary Putnam.Prerequisites. PHIL 12A, and willingness to engage both in mathematical and philosophical work.Textbook. Hunter, “Metalogic,” UC Press 1971. 146 
Philosophy of Mathematics.
Mancosu.
TuTh 9:30-11,
210 Wheeler.
The course is an introduction to the classics of philosophy of mathematics with emphasis on the debates on the foundations of mathematics. Topics to be covered: infinitist theorems in seventeenth century mathematics; the foundations of the Leibnizian differential calculus and Berkeley’s ‘Analyst’; Kant on pure intuition in arithmetic and geometry; the arithmetization of analysis (Bolzano, Dedekind); Frege’s logicism; the emergence of Cantorian set theory; Zermelo’s axiomatization of set theory; Hilbert’s program; Russell’s logicism; Brouwer’s intuitionism; Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.
Prerequisites: Phil 12A (or equivalent) and another course in philosophy161 
Aristotle.
Frede.
MWF 10-11,
213 Wheeler.
The course provides a study of the main areas of Aristotle’s works in the fields of logic, meta-physics, natural science, psychology and ethics/politics.  It will end with a brief overview of his poetics and rhetoric. Aristotle was not only the first philosopher who systematized the dif-ferent disciplines of philosophy, but also worked out their basic principles and method.  The course’s main concern will therefore be a proper understanding of the interconnection between the principles, method and the results of Aristotle’s thought.  Given the wide scope of his in-terests, the course will have to confine itself to a selective study of his works.  Since these works are hard to access because of their terse style, the readings will focus in the main on an analysis of selected texts taken from (ed.) Richard McKeon, The Basic Works of Aristotle.
Requirements: Three 5 page papers, one final paper.  176 
Hume.
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,
20 Barrows Hall.
A four unit course on the philosophy of David Hume (1711–1776), dealing as thoroughly as possible in the time available with many of the central issues of his major works. Students will be expected to read carefully, to discuss, and to write clearly and perceptively about those works and the problems they raise. No specific prerequisites; completion of at least Philosophy 25B is strongly advised. The richer one’s background in philosophy and the more one reads and thinks and discusses with others, the more one will get from the course. A large body of secondary literature and commentary can be helpful, but the emphasis throughout will be on the words and ideas of Hume himself.Lectures will discuss primarily but not exclusively the following topics: Introduction-the science of human nature; Operations of the mind: the theory of impressions and ideas; The idea of causation and its source in experience; Belief and the sources of beliefs about the unobserved; The idea of necessary connection; The continued and distinct existence of objects; The self: the idea of personal identity; Paradox, sceptical despair and its cure; Action and its source in feeling or passion; Freedom and necessity; Morality and its sources: not derived from reason; Feeling, sentiment, and sympathy as the basis of morality; The origin and rationale of justice as an ‘artificial virtue’; The origin of government and the source of political obligation; The human point or goal of philosophy.Course requirements: Three lectures per week; Participation in one discussion section per week; Four five-page papers on selected topics; Final examination.183 
Schopenhauer & Nietzsche.
Kaiser.
TuTh 12:30-2,
234 Moses Hall.
A systematic comparative study of the philosophy of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, with particular attention to the attitudes toward art and life of the two philosophers. Topics to be discussed include the nature of the will and the self; the problem of nihilism; the role of art, music, and aesthetic experience; and the psychology of value. Readings will include substantial excerpts from Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation and central texts by Nietzsche from the different phases of his philosophy. The course will be offered as a seminar with limited enrollment. Students will be required to participate actively in seminar discussions and to write a longer term paper.Enrollment is limited to 15 participants and is by application only. Preference will be given to philosophy majors. You should send an email to the instructor at kuk@berkeley.edu with a brief description detailing your interest in this seminar and your background in philosophy (including a list of philosophy courses you have already taken) by November 9th. Those accepted will be notified by email shortly thereafter and will be given the course enrollment code that is needed to register for the course. 189 
Special Topics in Recent European Philosophy.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 2-3:30,
213 Wheeler.
Philosophy 189: The Phenomenology of ActionThis course will consider what the phenomenological tradition has
contributed to the philosophical understanding of action. We will focus
 on the basic structures of everyday practical activity, various states of
absorption, mastery, and breakdown, and the role and limitations of
intentional content and practical reasoning. Readings mainly from
Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, McDowell, and Dreyfus, with attention
to related neo-Aristotelian and neo-Kantian views, time permitting.
Prerequisite: one upper-division course in phenomenology or ethics, or
permission of the instructor.290-1 
Graduate Seminar: Decision Theory: Preferences, Beliefs, and Desires.
Buchak.
W 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
At its core, decision theory is a mathematical theory that
relates preference, belief, and desire.  This theory is used in a variety of
ways: to guide action, to explain and predict behavior, to normatively
assess choices, and to gain access to mental states.  However, before it can
be adequate for any of these purposes, its theoretical core needs to be
expanded upon.  In particular, the notions of preference, belief, and desire
all need to be interpreted.
This seminar explores foundational issues in decision theory.  In
particular, we will focus on debates surrounding the analysis of preference,
belief, and desire.  Topics include the relationship between preference and
behavior; the relationship between desire and reason; incommensurable
values; substantive theories of utility; whether degrees of belief can be
vague; and other issues.  In addition to their importance to decision
theory, these debates touch on issues in ethics, epistemology, and
philosophy of mind.Requirements: graduate status or permission of the instructor.  No
background in decision theory is required, but students should be
comfortable with technical material.  290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Recent Topics in Epistemology: Logic, Formal Methods, and Epistemology.
Fitelson.
Tu 2-4,
2523 Tolman Hall.
In this seminar, we will cover various “hot topics” in contemporary epistemology.  The main focus/theme of the seminar will be on the (epistemic) normative status of logic and formal methods (e.g., the epistemic-normative role of deductive logic, and similar questions for various “inductive logical” frameworks).  Other topics will include the nature of evidence (e.g., is evidence factive and can there be “knowledge from falsehood”?), coherence requirements (e.g., is coherence a requirement of epistemic rationality?), and full vs partial belief as a foundation for epistemology (e.g., “probabilism” and other non-traditional frameworks for epistemology, as opposed to traditional “full belief” approaches).  We will have various guest presenters throughout the term, including Jim Joyce (Michigan), Jonathan Weisberg (Toronto), Matt Kotzen (UNC), and our own Roush, Kolodny, and Buchak.290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Consciousness.
Lee.
W 5-7,
211 Dwinelle.
This will be a seminar about consciousness. As well as being interested in first order questions about the nature of conscious experiences (we’ll focus on the implications and viability of the intentionalist program, and the relation between consciousness and accessibility) we will also be interested in two broad metatheoretical issues. First, to what extent is a systematic theory of the dependence of consciousness on the physical world possible? To address this, we’ll start with supervenience and the idea of experience-types having “neural correlates”, and then look at some different ways in which psychophysical dependence might (or might not) be more systematic than the existence of either of these relations alone implies. The second metatheoretical issue is this: is consciousness as intellectually and practically significant as is conventionally assumed, and (related to this) how many of the questions people typically ask about consciousness have determinate answers? We’ll explore a deflationary view that resembles the position that certain philosophers have taken in past about such concepts as personal identity and free will.290-4 
Graduate Seminar: Content without structure.
MacFarlane/Yalcin.
Tu 6-8,
234 Moses Hall.
Our standard ways of representing and attributing mental
states and speech acts involves two components, which Frege
called force and content. Believing that snow is white and
imagining that snow is white are attitudes that share a
content but differ in force; similarly, believing that snow
is white and believing that mud is red share a force but
differ in content. This approach gives us the efficiencies
of a division of labor. A single account of content can be
combined with accounts of various kinds of forces to yield
accounts of various kinds of attitudes and speech acts.We will focus on the question: What should we take contents
to be, given their roles in our psychological and linguistic
theories? The classic accounts given by Frege and Russell
take contents to be structured complexes of senses (on the
Fregean view) or objects and properties (on the Russellian
view). We will be primarily interested, however, in
unstructured conceptions, which take contents to be
functions from circumstances, possibilities, or conditions
to truth values.We will begin by looking at Stalnaker’s development of such
a conception in Inquiry. We will ask what motivates
Stalnaker’s conception of content, as against structured
alternatives, and what explanatory work it does. We will
then look at several objections to unstructured conceptions: The problem of logical omniscience.
Intuitively, one need not believe all of the necessary
consequences of one’s beliefs, but the unstructured
conception seems to entail that one does. Relatedly,
there are plausible psychological generalizations – for
example, that if one believes a conjunction, one must
believe both conjuncts, but need not believe all of
the necessary consequences of the conjunction – that it
seems cannot be stated in a framework that takes
contents to be unstructured.Aboutness.
Intuitively, beliefs are individuated in part by what
they are about (by their topics or subject matters),
but it is not clear how a notion of aboutness can be
defined that makes sense for unstructured propositions.Frege’s puzzle.
Intuitively, believing that Hesperus is visible is not
the same as believing that Phosphorus is visible, but on
an unstructured conception, the contents would seem to
be the same.De se attitudes.
Intuitively, I could be omniscient, in the sense of
knowing which world is actual, without knowing which
object in that world I am.  So standard unstructured
views do not seem to provide resources for describing
de se attitudes.Although some of these objections have been taken to
motivate structured theories of contents, we will be
particularly interested in seeing how unstructured theories
can evolve to meet them.  In addition to classic treatments
of these problems, we will look at some very recent (and in
some cases, future) work on them.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: Probability as Constraint and Representation.
Roush.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
This is a course about the use of probability in epistemology. Probability imports assumptions about and imposes constraints on any subject matter you use it to describe. Some of these constraints are well-known, but their implications are not always known or observed. In others it is an open question how much leeway probability allows. We discuss the fate of holism, foundationalism, introspective access, self-knowledge, and objects of belief under a probabilistic description. We consider the consequences of the globality of the P function and of extreme probabilities. Cases that are illuminating include the preface “paradox,” evidential support, re-calibration, justified belief, and the epistemology of logic. We discuss artifacts of representation and how to think about idealization in philosophy. 290-6 
Graduate Seminar: Perception, Mind and Language.
Searle.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
In this course, we will discuss some of the latest work in the Philosophy of Mind and the Philosophy of Perception.  We will also Fodor’s attempt to revive the language of mind hypothesis along with recent attacks on the Innateness Hypothesis.  Given the current scene, we also need to discuss disjunctivism.
Requirements:  graduate status or permission of the instructor. Students enrolled for credit must write a term paper.290-7 
Graduate Seminar: Concepts, Attitudes, and the Unity of Judgement.
Stroud.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
A wide-ranging seminar on the conditions of thought and of the attribution of attitudes.Some questions to be considered are: What is involved in possessing a concept by which you can think about something?  What does it take to have a thought that is true or false?  What is the relation between having a concept and having a capacity for judgement?  What is the role or significance of predication?  Can believing and other ‘propositional’ attitudes involving predication be understood as a person’s standing in a certain relation to certain objects?  If so, what relation?  What objects? If not, how is belief and the attribution of ‘propositional’ attitudes to others to be understood?  What metaphysical or epistemological consequences, if any, can be drawn from fulfillment of the necessary conditions of thought and of the attribution of attitudes?Readings from Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Geach, Quine, Evans, Strawson, Davidson and others, with additional secondary material.Those attending will be expected to contribute to the discussion.290-8 
Graduate Seminar: Practical Knowledge: Recent Work on Agency and Action.
Wallace.
M 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
There has recently been a striking resurgence of interest in the approaches of Anscombe and Aristotle to issues of agency, action, and practical norms.  In this seminar we will look at some recent work in this vein.  A central issue will be the explanation of what Anscombe called practical knowledge: our non-observational knowledge of what we are doing when we act.  Other topics will include the character of action as a (teleological) process; the relation of intentions to action; the structure of practical justification; and the source of the norms to which action is answerable.  We will start by reading Michael Thompson’s Life and Action, and then move on to look at work by Sebastian Rödl, Kieran Setiya, David Velleman, Richard Moran, Doug Lavin (among others).  Participants are strongly encouraged to (re-)read Anscombe’s Intention before the seminar begins.290-9 
Graduate Seminar: Leibniz’s Metaphysics.
Warren.
F 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
In the first part of this seminar (approximately 6 weeks) we will examine the Discourse on Metaphysics, Leibniz’s first systematic presentation of his mature metaphysical picture.  Central topics covered in this work include: the nature of substance, the containment theory of truth, the harmony between substances, necessary and contingent truth, efficient causes and teleology, activity and passivity, force and dynamical physics, the relation of mind and body.   As we make our way through the Discourse, we will supplement it by further readings from related works.  In the second part of the seminar (approximately 8 weeks) we will look at Leibniz’s early work, with an eye to understanding the stages through which his metaphysical views progressed and tracing the origins of the views presented in the Discourse.  In this second part we will take as a guide Christia Mercer’s book, Leibniz’s Metaphysics: Its Origin and Development .290-10 
Collaborative Research Seminar: Humanisitic and Empirical Studies in Moral Psychology.
Wallace.
W 4-6,
Townsend Center.
Humanistic and Empirical Research in Moral Psychology (cross listed in Law, Philosophy, and Psychology)Staff: Kathryn Abrams (Law), Alison Gopnik (Psychology), Christopher Kutz (Law/JSP), Anthony Long (Classics), Robert MacCoun (Law/JSP and Public Policy), and Jay Wallace (Philosophy)This interdisciplinary seminar, co-taught by five faculty, is sponsored by the Townsend Center for the Humanities.  Its aim is to draw together Berkeley faculty and graduate students studying the “moral emotions” – pride, shame, guilt, and anger – as well as related concepts and motivations, such as attributions of responsibility, altruism, self-interest, virtue, and character.  These concepts and emotions lie not only at the heart of moral and political philosophy, but also psychology, education, sociology, and economics.  Our seminar will pursue these subjects by looking at the intersection of research within these different disciplines, with each session introduced by one or more of the faculty conveners.  Graduate student participants will share responsibility for presenting some material, and will be expected to collaborate across disciplinary lines for their seminar projects.  We also expect campus and off-campus visitors to contribute to the meetings and possible special sessions.The seminar will meet in the Geballe Room of the Townsend Center on Wednesdays, 4-6pm. Graduate students from any university department are invited to apply, but space is limited, and admission will require the approval of the instructors.  Applicants should send a note of interest and an explanation of their relevant scholarly background to Robert MacCoun, maccoun@law.berkeley.edu, by December 15th, with the Subject line header “MORAL PSYCHOLOGY SEMINAR.”295

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Kohl.
MTuWTh 12-2,
156 Dwinelle.
We will survey some basic questions of moral and political philosophy, as
well as some influential attempts to answer them. The course consists of
two sections. In the first section, we are concerned with the authority
and the objectivity of morality. We will ask: Why should I care about what
morality tells me to do? Are there objective moral truths, or is what one
morally ought to do dependent on God, on one’s feelings, or on one’s
society? In the second section, we will consider what morality is all
about. Are we morally required to produce the best outcome? What is the
best outcome? Is there something wrong with thinking of morality as aimed
at producing the best outcome, and is there an alternative? Is being a
morally good agent compatible with pursuing personal projects and with
having deep relationships? We will relate these questions to concrete
political issues such as warfare, distributive justice, toleration of
alien practices, and respecting the majority vote in democratic states.Readings for the class will be drawn from both historical and contemporary
sources (among others, we will engage with the views of Plato, Aristotle,
Hobbes, Hume, and Kant). A course reader containing most of the texts will
be available in the week before classes start.7 
Existentialism in Literature&Film.
Tsai.
MTuWTh 10-12,
215 Dwinelle.
In this course, we will examine responses to the threat of nihilism—that
is, the threat that life is meaningless—in works of philosophy,
literature, and film.  To do so, we will grapple with a number of
questions including: What is our relation to the divine?  How can life be
worth living after the death of God?  How can one live a meaningful life? 
What makes an individual person or life authentic?  What is the
significance of death?  We will read works by Schopenhauer, Dostoevsky,
Nietzsche, Kafka, Sartre, Camus, and others, and view films including
Crimes and Misdemeanors, Groundhog Day, The Big Lebowski, American Beauty,
and Talk to Her.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Fitelson.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
9 Lewis.
Logic is about reasoning, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and how to tell the difference between good and bad reasoning.In this course, we will develop techniques for laying bare the structure of arguments (“reasonings”). This will enable us then to characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These three things — a conception of structure of arguments, a precise characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning — constitute a “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a conclusion.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
de Harven.
MTuWTh 12-2,
229 Dwinelle.
This course is designed as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally, and ancient philosophy in particular.  Those new to philosophy will learn the landscape by reading and writing about knowledge, the nature of reality, psychology, and ethics as the ancients saw it.  The ancient perspective is an excellent starting point not just for its historical role in philosophy, but for its contrast to many of our modern instincts.  Those with experience in philosophy will get acquainted not just with the striking differences between ancient and modern thinkers, but with the very elements for which Socrates, Plato and Aristotle are considered the founders of Western philosophy. 25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Schnee.
MTuWTh 10-12,
109 Dwinelle.
This course will focus on the major philosophers of the 17^th and 18^th centuries: Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Kant.  We will examine the metaphysical and epistemological views of these philosophers that arose as rejections of the Aristotelian philosophy of the Scholastic tradition.  Particular attention will be given to the relation between philosophy and the scientific revolution as well as to philosophical theories of our knowledge of the external world, the relation between mind and body, the existence and attributes of God, and the nature of physical matter, causation, space and time.  Readings will from primary sources (translations in most cases). 109 
Freedom & Responsibility.
Wallace.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
130 Wheeler.
The goal of the course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to historical and contemporary debates about the issues of freedom and responsibility.  We will look at the following questions (among others):  What is freedom of will?  What is it to be a free agent, or to have freedom of thought?  What kind of freedom do we require to be morally responsible for what we do?  Are freedom and responsibility possible if what we do is ultimately governed by deterministic laws?  Can moral agency be realized in the natural world?Readings will be drawn from both historical and contemporary sources.  Prerequisite: at least eight units in philosophy.Texts:G.

Philosophy of Mind.
Flanagan.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
130 Wheeler.
Humans, and possibly certain other creatures, are conscious. Life would have no personal meaning, it wouldn’t matter one bit (to each of us individually, at any rate), if it were not for consciousness. But what is consciousness? Does possession of consciousness require possession of a non-physical soul or does mind = brain in which case it will eventually be explained by neuroscience? Did some deity endow us with consciousness or is consciousness just one quirky outcome of the blind force of evolution by natural selection? Does my possession of a mind equip me with a free will that allows for personal responsibility, as well as blame and praise, for my actions? If my mind is just my brain then in what sense, am I free – the brain after all is just a 3 lb. piece of tissue and biology is thought to be governed by natural laws. Indeed, some have suggested that the idea of free will is an illusion. The course will introduce students to the main problems in the philosophy of mind: the nature of consciousness, the mind-body relation, free-will vs. determinism, the nature of personal identity. Nothing less that the meaning of life and the nature of morality rest on our understanding of our minds. No prior background in philosophy is required. Students interested in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, medicine, religion, and law will find much to interest them. 178 
Kant.

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Berkey.
MTuWTh 12-2,
156 Dwinelle.
This course is an introduction to moral and political philosophy.  We will
consider a range of ethical issues regarding individual conduct as well as
social arrangements, policies, and practices.  We will begin by
considering whether there are objective ethical truths, examining several
arguments for the view that ethics is not objective as well as responses
to those arguments.  Next we will consider what, if anything, well-off
individuals are obligated to do to aid the very poor.  We will then
examine the ethics of meat consumption, abortion, and euthanasia.  Next we
will look at two influential views of distributive justice, and consider
whether equality is a moral ideal that we should endorse and seek to
achieve.  We will then examine the ethics of affirmative action, and the
issues of free speech, tolerance, and multiculturalism.  We will conclude
by considering some ethical issues regarding war and terrorism.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Bezsylko.
MTuWTh 2-4,
223 Dwinelle.
The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to philosophy
 by doing philosophy of mind. We will begin by taking up the
 traditional question: What kind of thing is the mind? In connection
 with this question, we will engage with philosophers who think of the
 contents of the mind, things such as ideas, perceptions, beliefs,
 dreams, and imaginings, as something like pictures. We will focus on
 dreams in particular. From there, we will move on to an enormous
 question in the philosophy of mind which brings together a number of
 fascinating issues: Are human beings free? And if so, to what extent
 are they free and in what areas of our mental life does our freedom
 lie? In connection with this question, we will look at some writings
 in psychoanalysis and spend some time thinking about one particularly
 important domain of our freedom, namely: love. Throughout the course,
 we will learn how to read, think, speak, and write critically and with
 great precision and rigor.6 
Man, God, and Society in Western Literature.
Beattie.
MTuWTh 10-12,
215 Dwinelle.
In this course, we will read major works of literature with a philosophical eye.  In particular, we will examine how works drawn from the Ancient, Medieval, and Modern periods offer different viewpoints on issues including (but not limited to!) the following: humankind’s place in the world, the form of ‘the good life’, freedom and responsibility, the status and content of morality, the value of different social relationships…and the nature of the divine and how it relates to all of the foregoing.  The texts for the course are Homer’s The Odyssey, Dante’s The Inferno, and Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov.  It should be noted that there will be quite a lot of reading for this course – usually 50-70 pages a night, with no real breaks.  There will be several in-class writing assignments designed, in part, to reward those who keep up with the reading schedule. 12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Rieppel.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
136 Barrows.
What is it for an argument to be deductively valid? Intuitively, what’s
required is that the conclusion “follow from” the premises, or that the
truth of the premises “guarantee” the truth of the conclusion.  In this
course we will look at how to make this intuitive notion of validity
formally precise.  To this end, we will learn how to represent the
logical form of English arguments in increasingly more fine-grained
ways, and how to use semantic and syntactic methods to demonstrate the
validity of arguments given such formal representations.  Upon
completing the course, students can expect to be familiar with the basic
concepts of symbolic logic and to be in a better position to formulate
and evaluate arguments in natural languages like English.25A

Barnes.
MTuWTh 10-12,
209 Dwinelle.
Ancient Greek philosophy unearthed a number of enduring philosophical
problems.  In this class we will look at some of those problems in their
original context, with an eye to understanding not only what the problems
are, and why they arose, but also why many of them persist.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Bruce.
MTuWTh 12-2,
229 Dwinelle.
The course will survey some of the main metaphysical and epistemological positions of five important early modern philosophers:  Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant.  We will be concerned with their views regarding the structure of reality (the existence of God; the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body; the nature of bodies; causation) and with how we relate to the world around us (perception; the possibility of knowledge about the external world; induction).  We will consider these views in light of the scientific developments of the 17th and 18th centuries, as reactions to Aristotelian doctrine, and in their own right.  108 
Contemporary Ethical Issues.
Kolodny.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
175 Barrows.
NOTE: For Summer 2010, this course may be taken to satisfy the Department’s ethics requirement for the major.As a thoughtful person, living in this country, at this time, you have at some point asked yourself some of the following questions.  Are you allowed to buy yourself an iPod when you could use the money to save people from starving?  Should you buy a hybrid, rather than an SUV, when your individual choice is just “a drop in the bucket” and won’t really affect global warming?  Is there any difference between terrorism and “collateral damage”?  May we kill enemy soldiers or even civilians to protect ourselves?  Is abortion wrong?  Is it wrong to kill yourself to spare yourself a future of pain and debilitation?  Is it wrong for a doctor to help you to do this?  What is the point of punishing criminals?  Is there any point in it?  What do we owe to future generations?  Is it wrong to bring children into this world?These questions can be difficult for many different reasons.  Self-interest, prejudice, and fear can cloud our judgment.  Religious authorities that we accept on faith, such as the Bible, can give unclear or conflicting directions.  Finally, it can be hard to be sure of relevant facts: for example, whether the justice system applies the death penalty consistently, or whether burning fossil fuels leads to climate change.This course, however, is about another set of difficulties, which persist when we set aside our personal feelings, we see how far we can get without relying on faith, and we assume that we know the relevant facts.  We may not be able to decide, by our own reflection and reasoning, which answers are correct, and even when we are sure that certain answers are correct, we may not be able to justify them.  Our ethical ideas may seem not up to the task.  Our aim in this course is to come to terms with these difficulties and to see to what extent they can be overcome.153 
Chinese Philosophy.
Tiwald.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
136 Barrows.
This course will introduce students to the major schools of philosophy in
classical China, including Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism.
Although the course is meant primarily as a survey of the most important
Chinese thinkers, a prominent theme will be their views on moral cultivation
and moral agency. Philosophers of this era were greatly interested in the
development of good character and the key features of proper moral knowledge
and motivation. All Chinese texts will be in translation.187 
Special Topics in the History of Philosophy: Plato’s “Republic”.
Gelber.
TuWTh 3:30-6,
123 Wheeler.
This course will explore a number of perennial problems through a close reading of Plato’s literary and philosophical masterpiece, “The Republic”. While examining the ways these problems arise and the answers that Plato gives to them in this influential text, we will be asking ourselves whether these are answers we could endorse.
The issues that we will examine will include:
What does being a just or good person involve? Why do we want to be good or just?
How should our social institutions be structured in order to promote a just state? What should education be like, and what is it for? Is it ever permissible for the government to lie to the people? Is censorship ever justified? What role should women have in society? In order to understand Plato’s answers to these questions, we will delve into his moral psychology (the nature of the soul, of virtue, of moral beliefs, and the relation between reason and emotion) as well as the metaphysical and epistemological aspects of Plato’s Theory of Forms.Prerequisite: At least 8 units of philosophy or the instructor’s consent.Set translation:“Republic”, translated by Grube, revised by Reeve (Hackett).Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California3 
Nature of Mind.
Lee.
MWF 10-11,
145 Dwinelle.
This course will be an introduction to some of the major debates in
Philosophy of Mind. Is consciousness a purely physical phenomenon? Is
the brain a computer and the mind its software? Are our common-sense
ideas about how to explain people’s behavior compatible with
contemporary scientific views about the structure of the brain? How can
the mind represent the external world?6 
Man, God & Society in Western Literature.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 3:30-5,
145 Dwinelle.
This course will compare and contrast the Greek, Medieval, and Modern worlds as expressed in their greatest literature. We will follow in detail how in the West polytheism gradually became more and more monolithic until everything was understood in relation to a single God, and then how this synthesis fell apart and left our culture with a choice between nihilism or a return to polytheism.  The goal of the course is both to illustrate how to read difficult texts and to provide an understanding of the cultural paradigms that have formed and focused our shared beliefs and practices.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Roush.
MWF 11-12,

Ancient Philosophy.
Gelber.
MWF 9-10,
100 Lewis.
This course is an introduction to some of the main figures and problems in Ancient Greek Philosophy. We will read texts spanning from the Pre-Socratic through Hellenistic philosophers, but the majority of our attention will be given to Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. Our goal will be to understand not only what the views these thinkers held were, but why they held them and how they argued for them.100 
Philosophical Methods.
Lee.
M 2-4,
20 Barrows Hall.
A course to encourage in philosophy majors the practice and development of the skills of reading and writing in philosophy. Readings will be drawn from recent essays on a variety of subjects in different areas of philosophy. These will be discussed in one two-hour classroom meeting each week. Students will be expected to read and discuss the essays in class and to write clearly and accurately about them and about the questions they raise. Each student will meet individually each week with a graduate student instructor for close assessment and discussion of the student’s writing with special attention to how it could be improved. There will be a final paper on a topic of the student’s choice.104 
Ethical Theories.
Kolodny.
MWF 10-11,
105 Northgate.
This course will survey major treatments of the foundational questions of moral philosophy.  We will discuss the work of some or all of the following philosophers: Aristotle, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, Sidgwick, Moore, Scanlon and Korsgaard.116 
Special Topics in Political Philosophy.
Munoz-Dardé.
TuTh 11-12:30,
30 Wheeler.
As taught this semester, Phil 116 satisfies the ethics requirement for the philosophy major. This course is devoted to some of central questions in political philosophy:
authority, neutrality, rights, equality, pluralism, and well-being. It is focused
particularly on Joseph Raz’s The Morality of Freedom.The course is intended for juniors and seniors with substantial 
background in philosophy. Philosophy 115 or the equivalent is a 
prerequisite, and the course will presuppose familiarity with Rawls’s /A 
Theory of Justice.122 
Theory of Knowledge.
Roush.
MWF 2-3,
213 Wheeler.
By any (reasonable) account, human beings have more knowledge today than ever before due to the progress of science, but there is still philosophical disagreement about what knowledge is, how we should respond to radical skepticism, and how much science itself can tell us about knowledge. In this problem-oriented course we will study contemporary classics of epistemology on the topics of tracking, closure, relevant alternatives, reliabilism, internalism, externalism, and contextualism, among others. We will take epistemology to be responsible for understanding scientific cases of knowledge, and also consider the implications for epistemology of results in experimental psychology suggesting human beings’ lack of awareness of their true reasons for belief.133 
Philosophy of Language.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
4 LeConte.
The main purpose of this course is to answer the question, “How does language relate to the world?” In order to do this we will have to explore a lot of related questions, such as those concerning the nature of truth, reference, meaning, speech acts, metaphors, fiction, and pictures. We will also try to develop a general theoretical account of how human linguistic behavior is related to the rest of human behavior and to human mental states.There are two parts to the course. In the first part, I will explain how I think language ought to be studied philosophically. The philosophy of language is a branch of the philosophy of mind. In the second part of the course, I will teach mainstream philosophy of language, and attempt both to explain and criticize it.138 
Philosophy of Society.
Searle.
TuTh 2-3:30,
155 Kroeber.
How does human society differ from that of other social animals? How is it possible that there can be an objective reality of such things as money, property, government, marriage, and universities, even though such things exist only because we believe they exist? What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail? Are there human rights, and if so what are they and where do they come from?141 
Philosophy and Game Theory.
Buchak.
MWF 1-2,
100 Wheeler.
This course deals with applications of game theory and rational choice theory to philosophical problems, as well as with paradoxes and problems introduced by these theories. After introducing the basic concepts of game theory, the first part of the course will be devoted to problems of cooperation and convention: how people manage to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit, e.g. drive on the same side of the road, carry out a project together, or use language. The next section will explore non-cooperative games, such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma; the possible application of these games to moral problems; and the need for and execution of a social contract. Finally, we turn to problems dealing with groups, such as the problem of collective action, and some issues in group decision making.176

Nietzsche.
Sluga.
TuTh 2-3:30,

The course will seek to give a comprehensive picture of Nietzsche’s thought. To this end, we will follow the evolution of Nietzsche’s thinking from early works like /The Birth of Tragedy/ and /The Use and Abuse of History/ through his middle period represented by /The Gay Science/ and mature writings like /Beyond Good and Evil/ and /The Genealogy of Morals/ to his final effort to unite his thought in the comprehensive visions of /The Will to Power/.187

It will be accessible to anyone who has taken Philosophy 25A or equivalent.  At least 8 previously completed units of philosophy are required.Set translation:“Republic”, translated by Grube, revised by Reeve (Hackett).200 
First Year Graduate Seminar.
Stroud/Martin.
TBA,
TBA.
290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics.
Frede.
W 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
The seminar will be concerned with a detailed analysis and critical discussion of the basic principles of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics. It will focus on the conception of happiness as the good life, the distinction of character virtues and intellectual virtues as the basis of his phi-losophy of action.  It will also elucidate the Aristotelian explanation for the phenomenon of akrasia, his conception and evaluation of pleasure, and take up the controversy whether Aristotle’s explanation of the philosophical life as the supreme good is consistent with his basic principles of the good life.  The discussion will focus mainly on the text but also take note of crucial discussions in the secondary literature.
Requirements: two 20-minute in-class presentations on the text or relevant secondary literature, one final research-paper.290-3 
Graduate Seminar: A Society of Equals?.
Munoz-Dardé.
Tu 4-6,

Graduate Seminar: Philosophy of language: Perspective in Language.
Yalcin.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
The seminar will focus on questions which arise in connection with language that exhibits, or appears to exhibit, some relativity to a perspective. We will conduct three case studies, each on a different fragment of language: (1) the language of spatio-temporal position and orientation; (2) the language of probability; and (3) the language of evaluation (probably, aesthetic evaluation). We will use these fragments as windows into some basic issues in the philosophy of language, among them: the role of charity and of eligibility in interpretation, the scope and limits of truth-conditional semantics, the import of the demand that a theory of meaning be compositional, and the epistemological role of intuition in linguistics. We will be especially interested in developing a view about how semantic inquiry and metaphysical inquiry are related. 
Our case studies will drive us into areas well outside of the usual terrain of the philosophy of language, and the readings will be correspondingly diverse. During our first case study, we will look at aspects of the metaphysics of space and time, and at work on the perception of orientation; during the second, we will look into the metaphysics of probability, and get into issues about the semantics and logic of conditionals; and during the third, several reading will come from meta-ethics and aesthetics. Some people we may read: Chomsky, Egan, Field, Fillmore, Fodor, Gibbard, Gillies, Harman, Hume (on taste), Kant (on gloves), Kolodny, Kripke, Lee, Lewis, MacFarlane, Rothschild, Schroeder, Searle, Skow, Stalnaker, and Yalcin. 
Graduate students in linguistics are most welcome. 295

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Kolodny.
TuTh 8-9:30,
160 Kroeber.
We will survey the basic questions of moral and political philosophy, as well as some classic attempts to answer them. We will ask, among other things: What is the morally right thing for me to do? Why should I do it? Is there a fact of the matter what it is, or does it just depend on my feelings or upbringing? Why should I do what the government tells me to? Why should I tolerate alien moral beliefs and practices? We may read, among others: Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Bentham, Mill, and Nietzsche.11 
Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion.
Buchak.
TuTh 12:30-2,
60 Evans.
This course addresses basic questions in the philosophy of religion, primarily from the Western philosophical tradition. For example, does God exist? Should we believe in God? Are there such things as souls, and if so, how do they interact with the physical body? How should a just God punish us for our moral wrongdoing? Finally, is morality based on God’s commands? The course material will be arranged topically, rather than historically, and will be divided into four sections: arguments for and against the existence of God, epistemology, metaphysics, and morality.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Mancosu.
MWF 11-12,
2060 Valley.
The course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicates the intuitive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’) and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’). In addition, we will also develop techniques for showing when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus. Textbook: J. Barwise, J. Etchemendy, “Language, Proof and Logic”, latest edition. (The book comes with a CD. Do not buy the book used! If you do, you will not be able to submit your exercises on line, which you will be required to.)25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,
100 lewis.
An introduction to the history of modern philosophy through the problems and ideas of some of the most important philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  The course will focus on close reading and discussion of some of the major works of René Descartes, John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant.  Two lecture-discussion meetings and one discussion-section with a Graduate Student Instructor each week.  Several short papers during the semester and a final examination.  Written work will be assessed on the basis of its clarity, accuracy, and level of understanding of the philosophical issues in question.  Problems to be investigated, as they appear in the work of the different philosophers, include: What do we perceive, and how does it enable us to think and know things about the world?  What can we know of our own existence and nature?  How is the mind related to the body?  Do objects in the world really have colors, tastes, and smells, or do we only think so because of their effects on us?  Can we know that at least in general the world really is the way we believe it to be?  Can we have reason to believe things about what we have not so far experienced?  What is the difference between two things’ being connected as cause and effect and a mere coincidence, and how can we tell which is which?  Must we think some things are causally connected with others in order to think about an independent world at all?  Can we know some such things by thought alone, without dependence on sense-perception?  If so, what things, and how?  Is there a distinctive way in which philosophy asks and answers questions like these?  100

Aesthetics.
Noë.
MWF 12-1,
170 Barrows.
This course will explore topics in the philosophy of art. What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century).Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.This course is an upper division philosophy course. it is intended for students with some background in philosophy. Students with knowledge of the arts are welcome, space permitting, provided they are motivated to do philosophy.115 
Political Philosophy.
Sluga.
MWF 9-10,
141 McCone .
The course will examine some of the basic concepts of politics and specifically the concept of the political. This concern is motivated by the thought that our traditional understanding of politics (going ultimately back to Plato and Aristotle) has come or is coming apart. In the middle section of the course attention will be focused on the work of Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, and Michel Foucault and their attempts to re-conceptualize the field of politics. The final third of the course will consider how questions concerning technology, terrorism, globalization, and the environment affect the way we need to think about politics.125 
Metaphysics.
Yalcin.
TuTh 11-12:30,

An advanced introduction to contemporary metaphysics, focusing on the ideas of objectivity, existence, naturalness, identity, time, causation, and possibility.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
105 Northgate.
The single most important question in philosophy, and in intellectual life generally, at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action?
Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers?
How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments?
This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.142 
Philosophical Logic.
MacFarlane.
TuTh 12:30-2,
110 Wheeler Hall.
“Philosophical logic” includes both (a) the philosophical investigation of the fundamental concepts of logic and (b) the deployment of logical methods in the service of philosophical ends. We’ll tackle five interconnecting topics in philosophical logic:Quantifiers:  You may think you learned everything there is to
 know about quantifiers in Philosophy 12A. But in fact, there are
 quite a few quantificational idioms that we can’t understand in
 terms of the quantification theory you learned. We’ll look at the
 logic of identity, numerical quantifiers, generalized quantifiers,
 definite descriptions, substitutional quantifiers, and plural
 quantifiers.Modal logic: In addition to talking about what is the case, we
 talk about what might have been the case and what could not have
 been otherwise. Modal logic gives us tools to analyze reasoning
 involving these notions. We’ll get a basic grasp on some of the
 fundamentals of propositional modal logic, and then delve into
 some hairy conceptual problems surrounding quantified modal
 logic, explored by Quine, Kripke, and others. We’ll also look at
 the famous “slingshot argument,” which was used by Quine and
 Davidson to reject modal logic and correspondence theories of
 truth. At this point our work on definite descriptions will come
 in handy!Logical consequence: If you ask what logic is about, a
 reasonable (though not completely satisfactory) answer is that
 it’s the study of what follows from what, that is, of logical
 consequence. But how should we think of this relation? We’ll start
 by looking at Tarski’s account of logical consequence, which has
 become the orthodox account. On this account, logical consequence
 is a matter of truth preservation: P follows from Q if there is
 no model on which P is true and Q false. We’ll talk about how this
 account relates to the older idea that P follows from Q if it is
 impossible for P to be true and Q false. Then we’ll consider
 some alternatives. One alternative is to define consequence in
 terms of proof. We’ll look at a version of this idea by Dag
 Prawitz, which yields a nonclassical logic called “intuitionistic
 logic.” We’ll then look at the suggestion that relevance in
 addition to truth preservation is required for logical
 consequence. We’ll see how one might develop a nonclassical
 “relevance logic,” and we’ll consider some technical and
 philosophical issues that speak for and against a requirement of
 relevance. Finally, we’ll consider how, exactly, logic relates to
 reasoning.Conditionals: In Philosophy 12A you were taught to translate
 English conditionals using the “material conditional,” a
 truth-functional connective. This leads to some odd results: for
 example, “If I am currently on Mars, then I am a hippopotamus”
 comes out true (since the antecedent is false). We’ll start by
 considering some attempts to defend the material-conditional
 analysis of indicative conditionals in English. Then we’ll
 consider some alternatives, inculding Edgington’s view that
 indicative conditionals have no truth-conditions, Stalnaker’s
 elegant modal account, and the view that indicative conditionals
 should be understood as conditional assertions. Finally, we’ll
 look at McGee’s “counterexample to modus ponens,” and consider
 whether this sacrosanct inference rule is actually invalid!Vagueness: Finally we’ll turn to the “sorites paradox,” or
 paradox of the heap, which argues: five thousand grains of sand
 make a heap; taking one grain away from a heap still leaves you
 with a heap; so…one grain of sand makes a heap. Philosophical
 logicians have suggested that it is a mistake to use classical
 logic and semantics in analyzing this argument, and they have
 proposed a number of alternatives. We’ll consider three of them:
 (a) a three-valued logic, (b) a continuum-valued (or fuzzy) logic,
 and © a supervaluational approach that preserves classical logic
 (mostly) but not classical semantics. If there’s time, we’ll also
 look at a short argument by Gareth Evans that purports to show
 that vagueness must be a semantic phenomenon: that is, that there
 is no vagueness “in the world.”Requirements will include both papers and problem sets.Prerequisites: Philosophy 12A or equivalent, and at least one other course in philosophy. The course covers some technical material, but knowledge of logic beyond 12A will not be assumed.Books: Course Reader.160 
Plato.
Frede.
MWF 10-11,
20 Barrows Hall.
This course will mainly focus on Plato’s metaphysics and epistemology to elucidate what is meant by ‘Platonism’.  It therefore tries to reconstruct the development of the theory of Forms from its first traces in some of Plato’s early dialogues to its application in his middle years and possible revisions in his late work.  This reconstruction will at the same time require a discussion of the development in Plato’s theory of knowledge and of the methods he uses in connection with his different treatment of the Forms.  The focus will be on the central passages for this topic in Plato’s Euthyphro, Meno, Phaedo, Republic, Symposium, Phaedrus, Parmenides, Sophist, and the Philebus.
The discussion will focus largely on Plato’s texts but important secondary literature will be included and made available on bspace.  185 
Heidegger.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 11-12:30,
88 Dwinelle.
HEIDEGGER’S BEING AND TIME
One of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century, Being and Time is both a systematization of the existential insights of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and a radicalization of Husserl’s phenomenological account of intentionality.  What results is an original interpretation of the human condition and an account of the nature and limitations of philosophical and scientific theory.  This account has important implications for all those disciplines that study human beings. Prerequisites:
History of Modern Philosophy (25B) or an equivalent course is required.  It would also help to take Searle’s Philosophy of Mind (132) and/or Kant (178).186b 
Later Wittgenstein.
Stroud.
TuTh 2-3:30,
210 Wheeler.
A course of close reading and detailed discussion of central parts of Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations.  The aim is to understand Wittgenstein’s later work and its philosophical significance by responding as directly and as sympathetically as possible to the problems and lines of thought as they are presented in that book.  Some other works of Wittgenstein and some interpretative commentary will be consulted occasionally, but the emphasis throughout will be on that book alone.  Because the book embodies a conception of philosophy as a certain kind of activity, the course will be of greatest interest and value to those willing to engage in philosophical reflection of their own in response to Wittgenstein’s thinking.  That requires careful attention to the text, active participation in classroom discussion in response to others’ contributions, and an effort to keep sharpening one’s own understanding of the issues in question.  The course is meant to be as much as possible a course in doing philosophy, not just a commentary on somebody’s philosophy.187 
Special Topics in the History of Philosophy: Aristotle’s Metaphysics and Science.
Gelber.
M 2-5,
332 Giannini.
Pre-requisites: At least 8 units of philosophy, preferably including Philosophy 25a. In the first two books of the Physics, his introductory work on natural science, Aristotle articulates and argues for some of his most well known philosophical doctrines. They serve as an excellent introduction to central issues in Aristotle’s philosophy. In these short two books he addresses such issues as:What is required in order to explain changes?What makes it the case that something is natural? What is a cause?Do some things occur by chance?Are natural phenomena, such as the growth of a tree, solely due to properties of its material constituents? Or are there additional causal factors?In this course, we will use Physics I and II as a guide, drawing on works from throughout the Aristotelian corpus. In addition to understanding what Aristotle’s positions are, we will also ask ourselves whether, and to what extent, the concepts and distinctions that Aristotle employs are still tenable. If they are, in what sorts of contexts can they be applied? If not, what does this tell us about our own philosophical outlook and presuppositions? The format of this course will be a seminar, and enrollment is limited to 20 participants(For this semester, this course may satisfy the 160-178 requirement for the major.)290-1 
Graduate Seminar: Science & Religion.
Buchak.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses.
This course will explore the questions about the relationship between
science and religion.  If we take current science seriously, what room, if
any, is left for religion?  We will look at the assumptions behind doing
science and the assumptions behind practicing religion, and examine
whether these conflict.  We will also examine whether evolutionary theory
leaves room for the existence of a God who intervenes; whether the
“fine-tuning” of the physical constants is evidence for God’s existence
and whether the Anthropic Principle constitutes a good reply to the
fine-tuning argument; and whether one can survive one’s own death. 
Finally, we will examine what faith is and the relationship between faith,
religious belief, and evidence.This course is intended for graduate students in philosophy, but advanced
undergraduates may enroll with permission.  No background in philosophy of
religion or philosophy of science is required.290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Democratic Authority.
Kolodny.
Tu 2-4,
108 Wheeler.
It is often thought that the fact that a collective policy has been democratically selected is a reason, of a moral character, in favor of complying, or not interfering, with it.  Either the fact that a policy was democratically selected /strengthens /the objection that others have to one’s refusing to comply with it (or to one’s interfering with it), thereby adding to the case for one’s being morally /required /to comply (or to refrain from interfering) with it.  Or it /weakens /the objection that one has to their doing otherwise objectionable things in pursuit of that policy (such as threatening coercive force), thereby adding to the case for their being morally /permitted /to do those things.  Why?  No doubt, the fact that a collective policy is /substantively good/—good in ways that do not depend on what individuals have decided, or think, about it—is a reason, often of a broadly moral character, to comply with it.  But why should the fact that people /think /that the policy is good, or /choose /it, be a reason to comply with it?  We will read work on these questions by Charles Beitz, Joshua Cohen, Thomas Christiano, and David Estlund.290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Metaphysics : Objects and Properties.
Lee.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses.
This class will survey some recent literature in
metaphysics, with a particular focus on issues concerning the
constitution of objects, and the nature of properties. Topics we’ll
discuss will include : Realism and Nominalism, The Relationship
between Properties and Particulars, Supervenience and Constitution,
Fundamentality, Intrinsicness, External vs Internal Relations,
Quantities and Measurement, The Causal Theory of Properties, Humean
Supervenience, Mereology and Composition, Location, 3 Dimensionalism vs 4 Dimensionalism.290-4 
Graduate Seminar: Expressivism and Relativism.
MacFarlane.
Tu 6-8,
234 Moses.
My judgments that a certain dish is tasty and that it is likely to rain tomorrow do not seem to be judgments about an objective domain of reality, independent of my own tastes and information. Yet they seem to be more than mere reports of my own tastes and information; for example, they can serve as loci of interpersonal disagreements. So how should we understand them? Both expressivism and relativism advertise themselves as ways of steering between the Scylla of excessive subjectivism and the Charybdis of excessive objectivism. In this seminar we will look at both approaches, with a focus on expressivism. We will be particularly concerned with understanding just how the two approaches differ, when both are fully developed, and how each differs from the subjectivist and objectivist views they are seeking to avoid. For concreteness and to ease comparison, we will focus on claims of taste and likelihood, even though much of the discussion concerns normative judgment. Readings will be drawn from A. J. Ayer, C. L. Stevenson, Peter Geach, Simon Blackburn, Allan Gibbard, Huw Price, Mark Schroeder, Frank Jackson, Jamie Dreier, Gideon Rosen, and others (including some unpublished work of my own).290-5

Graduate Seminar: Probability as Constraint and Representation.
Roush.
W 2-4,
234 Moses.
This is a course about the use of probability in epistemology. Probability imports assumptions about and imposes constraints on any subject matter you use it to describe. Some of these constraints are well-known, but their implications are not always known or observed. In others it is an open question how much leeway probability allows. We discuss the fate of holism, foundationalism, introspective access, self-knowledge, and objects of belief under a probabilistic description. We consider the consequences of the globality of the P function and of extreme probabilities. Cases that are illuminating include the preface “paradox,” evidential support, re-calibration, justified belief, and the epistemology of logic. We discuss artifacts of representation and how to think about idealization in philosophy.290-7

Topics in Religious Studies: Ethics of Rights, Gender, and Global Justice: East and West.
Bilimoria.
MW 4-5:30,
110 Wheeler.
NOTE: For the Spring 2011 semester, this Religious Studies course may be used as an upper-division Philosophy elective towards the Major.The course focuses on major founding insights, principles and practical explication of the ethics of rights and ideas on justice, both in Western and Eastern traditions and in- between (Hellenistic, Indian, Chinese, Postcolonial). The course examines the foundational basis in morality for cultural values, religious beliefs and practices, law, justice and human rights, and ecological attitudes, as these have developed from classical to contemporary times, in religions and secular idelogies. Following a survey of key Western moral systems, beginning with their religious roots, including ideas of justice and liberalism, and their critiques (Plato, Socrates, Augustine, Grotius, Kant, Hegel, Mills, MacIntyre, Williams, Rawls, Nozick, Cavell, Sen, Nussbaum), the course critically engages Hindu, Buddhist-Jaina (Dharma) ethics, and their responses to the Asia’s moral, social and legal challenges. Similar issues are examined in the context of the dynastic and Confucian vs Daoist debates in Chinese texts. In terms of structure, the theoretical part of the course will map the formative impact of competing ethical theories that have determined the culture, or have in turn been criticized and transformed in their respective intellectual histories. The latter part will center on practical moral issues, particularly the dialectics of caste/class hierarchy versus autonomy of the individual, despotic governance vs democratic/liberal processes, rights trumping rites (duties), patriarchy vs gender justice, virtues vs instrumentalism, normativity vs intuition, as well as bioethical, animal and environmental issues. How the cultures of East & West, comparatively, have meet these challenges amidst diversity and plurality of communities, moral ideals, legal systems and practices is a question that will also inform the inquiry.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California2 
Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Berkey.
MTuWTh 12-2,
229 Dwinelle.
This course is an introduction to moral and political philosophy. We will
consider a range of ethical issues regarding individual conduct as well as
social arrangements, policies, and practices. We will begin by considering
whether there are objective ethical truths, examining several arguments
for the view that ethics is not objective as well as responses to those
arguments. Next we will consider what, if anything, well-off individuals
are obligated to do to aid the very poor. We will then examine the ethics
of meat consumption, abortion, and euthanasia. Next we will look at two
influential views of distributive justice, and consider whether equality
is a moral ideal that we should endorse and seek to achieve. We will then
examine the ethics of affirmative action, and the issues of free speech,
tolerance, and multiculturalism. We will conclude by considering some
ethical issues regarding war and terrorism.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Rieppel.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
209 Dwinelle.
What is it for an argument to be deductively valid? Intuitively,
what’s required is that the conclusion “follow from” the premises, or
that the truth of the premises “guarantee” the truth of the
conclusion.  In this course we will look at how this notion is made
formally precise in three systems of logic: sentential logic, monadic
predicate logic, and full first order logic.  We will learn how to
represent the logical forms of English arguments in each of these
systems, and then develop a semantics as well as a system of natural
deduction in each system to assess the validity of arguments given
such formal representations.  Upon completing the course, students can
expect to be familiar with the basic concepts of symbolic logic, and
to be in a better position to formulate and evaluate arguments in
natural languages like English.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
de Harven.
MTuWTh 10-12,
229 Dwinelle.
This course is designed as an introduction to philosophical thinking
generally, and ancient philosophy in particular.  Those new to
philosophy will learn the landscape by reading and writing about
knowledge, the nature of reality, psychology, and ethics as the Greeks
saw it.  Those with experience in philosophy will see that the ancient
perspective is an excellent starting point not just for its historical
role in philosophy, but also for its contrast to many of our modern
instincts and at the same time for its relevance to ongoing
philosophical debates.  We will get acquainted with the striking
differences between ancient and modern thinkers, and with the very
elements for which Socrates, Plato and Aristotle are considered the
founders of Western philosophy.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Bruce.
MTuWTh 12-2,
223 Dwinelle.
The course will survey some of the main metaphysical and
epistemological positions of five important early modern
philosophers:  Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant.  We will
be concerned with their views regarding the structure of reality (the
existence of God; the nature of the human mind and its relation to the
body; the nature of bodies; causation) and with how we relate to the
world around us (perception; the possibility of knowledge about the
external world; induction).  We will consider these views in light of
the scientific developments of the 17th and 18th centuries, as
reactions to Aristotelian doctrine, and in their own right.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Flanagan.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
155 Barrows.
Humans, and possibly certain other creatures, are conscious. Life would have no personal meaning, it wouldn’t matter one bit (to each of us individually, at any rate), if it were not for consciousness. But what is consciousness? Does possession of consciousness require possession of a non-physical soul or does mind = brain in which case it will eventually be explained by neuroscience? Did some deity endow us with consciousness or is consciousness just one quirky outcome of the blind force of evolution by natural selection? Does my possession of a mind equip me with a free will that allows for personal responsibility, as well as blame and praise, for my actions? If my mind is just my brain then in what sense, am I free — the brain after all is just a 3 lb. piece of tissue and biology is thought to be governed by natural laws. Indeed, some have suggested that the idea of free will is an illusion.The course will introduce students to the main problems in the philosophy of mind: the nature of consciousness, the mind-body relation, free-will vs. determinism, the nature of personal identity. Nothing less that the meaning of life and the nature of morality rest on our understanding of our minds. No prior background in philosophy is required. Students interested in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, medicine, religion, and law will find much to interest them.153 
Chinese Philosophy.
Tiwald.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
TBA.
This course will introduce students to the major schools of philosophy in classical China, including Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism. Although the course is meant primarily as a survey of the most important Chinese thinkers, a prominent theme will be their views on moral cultivation and moral agency. Philosophers of this era were greatly interested in the development of good character and the key features of proper moral knowledge and motivation. All Chinese texts will be in translation.178 
Kant.
Mras.
TuWTh 3:30-6,
215 Dwinelle.
The course will provide an examination of Kant’s critical philosophy. The first part will be devoted to the peculiarity of Kant’s Copernican Revolution, understanding transcendental idealism to be a necessary condition for empirical realism. In this part we will be primarily concerned with Kant’s his relationship to Leibniz and Wolff, his view of philosophy’s proper ‘method’, and the proof structure of the ‘transcendental deduction”. The readings will include in addition to sections from the Critique of Pure Reason and the Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics extracts from his dissertation. The second part of the course will deal with what is for Kant a condition for a subject to exhibit one’s freedom, i.e. his understanding of autonomy and its development from the lecture notes on moral philosophy by Kaehler via the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals to the Critique of Practical Reason. In the end of the course the relationship of these two critiques will be discussed and questions will be raised about the whole system that is supposed to be the outcome of the combination of Kant’s three critiques.

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Matthes.
MTuWTh 12-2,
223 Dwinelle.
This class is an introduction to moral and political philosophy that 
will cover three general areas. First, we will examine Utilitarianism, a 
divisive theory of normative ethics that will provide us the opportunity 
to learn and practice techniques for constructing and evaluating moral 
theories. Through reading the work of proponents and detractors, we will 
investigate how to argue for or against a specific theory of what one 
ought to do, and we will briefly consider an alternative picture in the 
form of Kantianism. Second, we will turn to some questions about the 
foundations and objectivity of moral claims, what is usually called 
“meta-ethics.” Can moral claims be true? Are any moral claims true? True 
for whom? You, our country, everyone? What could make them true? In this 
part of the course, we will structure our investigation around a single 
sustained piece of philosophical writing that explores these very 
questions. Finally, we will attempt to apply what we have learned about 
foundations and theories in moral philosophy to a few specific issues 
that will move our discussion into the domain of the political. These 
issues will include the moral status of non-human animals, the 
permissibility of abortion, freedom of speech and expression, and 
justifications of partiality and nationalism.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Winzeler.
MTuWTh 10-12,
223 Dwinelle.
This course is an introduction to the philosophical study of the mind.
We will start off by investigating the Mind-Body problem: that is, how
exactly are the mind and body related to one another? Are they two
wholly separate things? Or is the mind just identical to the brain?
Alternatively, the mind might just be a computer program, with the
implication that machines could be capable of thought and other mental
states. We will study the strong and weak points of all of these
theories: Dualism, Identity Theory, Behaviorism and Functionalism.
  We will go on to look at the phenomenon of consciousness. We will ask:
what is consciousness? Can we describe it scientifically? What is
special about the conscious states that we refer to as “emotions”? We
will end the course by studying how we should regard the content of our
mental states. In essence, we will try to see if content is internally
or externally determined. How much does the environment in which we are
placed get into our heads? Again, the overarching theme and goal of
this question, as well as all the others, will be a deeper
understanding of how our minds and the physical world around us are
related.6 
Man, God & Society in Western Literature.
Beeghly.
MTuWTh 2-4,
215 Dwinelle.
What is justice?  Where do the mandates of justice come from and why do they have authority over us?  How do we know what is just?  When and how should wrongdoers be punished?  Is it better to be just than unjust?  A long line of philosophers have asked these questions.  Though they often disagree wildly, their exploration of the questions tends to take a similar form.  An author articulates a view, presents objections to that view, then defends the view.  Fiction, poetry, autobiography work differently.  In this course, we will consider classic works of Western literature, both fiction and non-fiction.  We will consider how these texts explore questions about justice, the answers that they offer us (if any), and how all of this relates to philosophical debates about justice.  As we go along, we will contrast texts from Ancient Greece, early and medieval Christianity, the Enlightenment, and more contemporary times.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Bledin.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
174 Barrows.
In this introductory course in symbolic logic, students will acquire a
working knowledge of Propositional and Predicate Logic. Students will
learn how to translate natural language expressions into formal language,
and then explore important semantic notions like logical consequence,
consistency and tautology. Students will also learn natural deduction
proof systems for both logics, and if time permits, some metatheoretical
issues will be covered, such as the soundness and completeness of the
propositional calculus.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Barnes.
MTuWTh 10-12,
209 Dwinelle.
Ancient Greek philosophy unearthed a number of enduring philosophical
problems. In this class we will look at some of those problems in their
original context, with an eye to understanding not only what the problems
are, and why they arose, but also why many of them persist.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Crawford.
MTuWTh 12-2,
209 Dwinelle.
This course provides a survey of some of the works of
six major figures central to the development of philosophical thought in
the early modern period: Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and
Kant. We
will focus on these figures’ work in the areas of metaphysics and
epistemology and trace the development of particular philosophical
problems and ideas through each figure. Questions we will be examining
include: What is the mind, and what is its relation to the body? What is
God? What does perception reveal, and what are its limits? What can we
know through the faculty of reason alone? We will consider these and other
questions, and how they were approached, both within their historical
contexts and as they stand on their own.115 
Political Philosophy.
Grosser.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
156 Dwinelle.
This introductory course will examine the works of four classical protagonists of Western political thought, Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, and John Rawls. It is meant to provide students with a basic understanding of paradigmatic ancient, modern, and contemporary political theories: An understanding of the respective metaphysical and ontological, rationalist and contractarian approaches that essentially inform these theories; of the underlying anthropological assumptions; of the relevance and specific meaning of concepts such as justice, freedom, security, and power; and, most importantly, of differing strategies of justifying the existence of the state philosophically. Thus, based on a careful reading of their politico-philosophical writings, it is to be considered how Plato and Aristotle, Hobbes and Rawls aim at finding a balance that resolves the tension that inescapably exists between (stately) authority and (individual) autonomy. Additionally, the course aims at identifying the concepts of the political that implicitly or explicitly organize the political theories discussed.128 
Philosophy of Science.
Skokowski.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
TBA.
This course is an intermediate level introduction to problems in philosophy of science through readings of primary sources. We will examine several movements in recent philosophy of science ranging from logical positivism to realism and anti-realism about scientific theories and entities. We will also examine philosophical problems in specific sciences, including, for example, physics.  A scientific or technical background is not required - just a philosophical curiosity about science.181 
Hegel.
Mras.
TuWTh 3:30-6,
209 Dwinelle.
This course will give an overview of Hegel’s philosophy in order to make students familiar with the significance of ‘absolute idealism’ in the philosophy of the 18th and 19th century. The major themes that will be discussed are: Hegel’s criticism of Empiricism as presented in the Phenomenology of Sprit, his account of experience in the Phenomenology of Sprit and the Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences, Hegel’s criticism of Kant and his pursuing the aim to show skepticism to be ultimately unintelligible; as it is argued for in the Logic of Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences and by the idea of a unity of the three volumes of the Encyclopedia. 
We shall be interested in reading closely the section on consciousness in the Phenomenology of Sprit, the ‘three attitudes of thought to objectivity’ in the Encyclopedia I and the section ‘subjective logic’ in the same work. This course will also cover essential ideas in Hegel’s thoughts about mind, nature and history in order to make understandable the relationship envisages of a philosophy of mind, logic and nature.     The course will presuppose no prior knowledge of Hegel. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaR1B

Nature of Mind.
Campbell.
MWF 2-3,
145 Dwinelle.
In this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Roush.
MWF 10-11,
159 Mulford.
This is a first course in logic. We study first-order logic: boolean connectives and conditionals, formal proof, logical consequence, validity and soundness of arguments, quantification. We learn how to argue for logical properties using models and formal proof methods.24 
Freshman Seminar: Philosophy and the Meaning of Life.
Wallace.
W 12-1,
234 Moses.
In this seminar we will take a philosophical look at some ancient questions about the meaning of life.  What is it that makes life worth living, from the agent’s point of view?  What is the relation between morality and the good life?  (Can one live well, as an individual, only if one complies with moral requirements?  Or does morality sometimes interfere with the conditions for living a meaningful life?)  Can life have meaning if there are no objective values?  What is the significance of our mortality for the question of life’s meaning?  Finally, what is the relation of philosophy itself to the meaning of life?  Is there any truth in the dictum that the unexamined life is not worth living?  Readings will be taken primarily from contemporary philosophical sources.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Corcilius.
MWF 12-1,
145 Dwinelle.
This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. It 
provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek 
philosophical thinking from the pre-Socratic beginnings to the 
hellenistic period. The bulk of the course will be spent on the analysis 
of the philosophical motives, methods and views of Socrates (469 - 399 
BC), Plato (427-347 BC), and Aristotle (384-322 BC). Since the ancient 
Greeks identified many of the philosophical problems (and  models for 
their resolution) we are still concerned with today, the course may also 
serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally.100 
Philosophical Methods.
Warren.
W 2-4,
88 Dwinelle.
THIS COURSE IS RESTRICTED TO PHILOSOPHY MAJORS.  It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy.  Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills.  This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the problem of personal identity.  There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading.  In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper.Text: Personal Identity, edited by John Perry, University of California Press104 
Ethical Theories.
Wallace.
MWF 10-11,
101 LSA.
This course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy.  We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as influential work by important contemporary philosophers (including Korsgaard, Nagel, Scanlon, and Williams).  Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)?  Why should we care about complying with moral demands?  What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)?  116 
Special Topics in Political Philosophy.
Munoz-Dardé.
MWF 11-12,

This course will be taught in seminar format, with two weekly meetings 
and enrollment limited to fifteen students. It is devoted to some of 
central questions in political philosophy: consent, authority, 
neutrality, rights, equality, pluralism, and well-being. The primary 
focus will be on contemporary philosophical thought in the liberal 
tradition, with special emphasis on the work of Rawls and Raz.122 
Theory of Knowledge.
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,
159 Mulford.
An upper-division course on the philosophical theory of knowledge.  Not a general survey of the field, but an examination and discussion of the nature and source of three fundamental epistemological problems.How does what we perceive by the senses on a particular 
occasion give us knowledge of what is so in our immediate
environment at that time?How does what we perceive or have perceived in the past give
us reason to believe something about what we have not yet 
perceived?How does what one person perceives to be true of another person 
give the perceiver reason to believe something about what the other
person thinks or feels?It has proved difficult to find philosophically satisfying explanations of knowledge or reasonable beliefs of these kinds.  This course will concentrate on the distinctive philosophical character of the problems, on the conceptions of human perception, thought, belief, and knowledge that appear to be responsible for the ‘sceptical’ outcome in each case, and on how, if at all, these obstacles are to be overcome.Two lecture-discussion classes and one mandatory discussion section each week.  Lectures and discussions will presuppose close reading of material available in a Philosophy 122 Reader.  Barry Stroud’s The Significance of Philosophical Scepticism would be useful as background.In addition to whatever writing is assigned in connection with discussion sections, students will be expected to write three five-page papers during the semester, one on each of the three philosophical questions.  Possible paper topics will be suggested in each case.133 
Philosophy of Language.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
145 Dwinelle.
The main purpose of this course is to answer the question, “How does language relate to the world?” In order to do this we will have to explore a lot of related questions, such as those concerning the nature of truth, reference, meaning, speech acts, metaphors, fiction, and pictures. We will also try to develop a general theoretical account of how human linguistic behavior is related to the rest of human behavior and to human mental states.There are two parts to the course. In the first part, I will explain how I think language ought to be studied philosophically. The philosophy of language is a branch of the philosophy of mind. In the second part of the course, I will teach mainstream philosophy of language, and attempt both to explain and criticize it.134 
Form & Meaning.
Yalcin.
MWF 12-1,
220 Wheeler.
How is the meaning of a whole sentence determined by the meanings of its
parts, and by its structure? This question is addressed in empirical
semantic theories for natural language. The character and content of such
theories has been a central concern both of the philosophy of language and
of recent linguistics, and it is the central focus of this course.
Students will become familiar with truth-conditional semantics for natural
language in the model-theoretic tradition stemming from the classic work
of Frege and Tarski and developed by Montague, Davidson, Lewis, and
others. We will investigate the proper treatment of predicates, modifiers,
quantifiers, modals, conditionals, names, descriptions, and attitudes
within this kind of approach to linguistic meaning. Along this the way we
will: develop a sense of what it means for a semantic theory to be
compositional; ask how debates within a compositional semantic theory
interact with foundational questions in the philosophy of language; and
develop a conception of how natural language semantics relates to syntax,
to pragmatics, and to psychological theories of human cognition.Philosophy 12A (introduction to logic) is a prerequisite to this course.136 
Philosophy of Perception.

Philosophy of Society.
Searle.
TuTh 2-3:30,
213 Wheeler.
How does human society differ from that of other social animals? How is it possible that there can be an objective reality of such things as money, property, government, marriage, and universities, even though such things exist only because we believe they exist? What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail? Are there human rights, and if so what are they and where do they come from?170 
Descartes.
Crockett.
TuTh 12:30-2,
110 Wheeler.
This course will provide an intensive introduction to Descartes’s views on metaphysics, epistemology, and physics.  We will begin by examining some of Descartes’s early works on method, physics, and physiology.  We will then turn to an in-depth study of the Meditations, focusing on both Descartes’s epistemological project and his anti-scholastic metaphysics.  We will supplement our study of the Meditations with readings from the Objections and Replies, the Principles, and several important pieces of secondary literature.  Some of the issues we will discuss in this section include the method of doubt, the Cartesian circle, Descartes’s mode of presentation in the Meditations, the creation and ontological status of the eternal truths, the status of the human being, the nature of substance, and the real distinction between mind and body.  After our study of the Meditations, we will examine Descartes’s physics as presented in the Principles.178 
Kant.
Warren.
TuTh 2-3:30,
220 Wheeler.
In this course we will examine some of the major metaphysical and epistemological themes of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason.  We will be focusing particularly on Kant’s views on the following topics: a priori knowledge and how it is possible, space and time, objectivity and experience, self-knowledge, and transcendental idealism and the contrast between appearances and things in themselves. Several short papers and two longer papers will be required.Prerequisite: Philosophy 25 [History of Modern Philosophy (17th&18th centuries)]Texts: Required: 
Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, transl’d by Norman Kemp Smith;

Special Topics in Recent European Philosophy: Later Heidegger.
Kaiser.
M 2-5,
79 Dwinelle.
The goal of this seminar is to come to an understanding of the close connections between art, poetry and technology in Heidegger’s later philosophy. These topics will be explored through a close look at his engagement with the works of Nietzsche and Hölderlin, especially the former’s diagnosis of our nihilistic predicament (“The desert grows”) and the special status that he assigned to art. But it is not Nietzsche —according to Heidegger he ultimately failed to free himself (and us) from the fetters of metaphysics—who can point the way out of our ‘forgetfulness of being’. It is in reflective thinking, art, poetry (especially that of Hölderlin) and ‘dwelling with things’ that the ‘saving power’ is to be found.Readings will include essays and excerpts from Heidegger’s lectures on Nietzsche and Hölderlin; we will also look at such central texts as “The Origin of the Work of Art”, “The Question Concerning Technology”,  and “Building, Dwelling, Thinking”.The seminar is aimed at advanced students of philosophy, preferably with some background in the work of Heidegger and/or Nietzsche.Enrollment is limited, and by application only. Students may apply to the instructor directly (at kuk@berkeley.edu). Applications should include a brief statement outlining the applicant’s philosophical background and interest in the seminar.  All applicants will be notified via email as to the result of their application; those admitted will receive course enrollment numbers with which they can enroll in the seminar through TeleBears.200

Graduate Seminar: The Experience of Time and the Unity of Consciousness.
Lee.
M 2-4,
234 Moses.
This class will address the following questions : What is it for a “stream of consciousness” to exist? What kind of structure does conscious experience have, both at a time and over time? What is it to experience time passing? Is there such a thing as “subjective time”, or “phenomenal time”, to be distinguished from the objective physical time that events occur in? What support, if any, does the experience of time provide to different views of the metaphysics of time?
We will look carefully at the notions of an “experience” and a “subject of experience”, and the idea of one experience being “unified” with another by being part of a larger experience. We will relate these ideas to certain fundamental questions about the timing and temporal structure of conscious experience (e.g. is it discrete, continuous, or something else?), including a discussion of the “unity” of experience over time. Following on from this, we’ll take a look at some different views of temporal experience, including Husserl’s “tripartite” conception. We’ll then ask whether there are aspects of temporal experience that aren’t captured by any of these views – an experience of temporal passage that isn’t an experience of temporal relations between events, or a purely subjective aspect to temporal experience, that might deserve the name “phenomenal time”. Finally, we’ll take a look at the experience of time as a source of evidence in debates about the metaphysics of time: does experience support the claim that there is an objective “moving present”, or some kind of deep asymmetry between past, present and future?
Although the focus of the class will be more philosophical than empirical, we will be taking a look at some of the empirical literature on the representation of time in the brain where it is relevant, in addition to discussing relevant philosophical literature.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: Regulation of Intimacy: The Politics of Sex.
Munoz-Dardé.
W 2-4,
234 Moses.
Should we recognize a private sphere of relations among individuals, sexual and intimate relations, which we consider beyond any regulation by the state? Should there be state recognition or regulation of the family, and the relations within the family? What, if anything, is wrong with prostitution? And should any such wrong be reflected in laws which govern prostitution? Should marriage have standing as a state institution? These practical questions raise a number of more general ethical concerns which will be our focus in this seminar: i.) Should some things not be for sale? ii.) In what sense, if any, is the personal political? iii.) Are there basic rights of self-ownership? iv.) Is consent the key to legitimate interaction? v.) What is involved in one person ‘objectifying’ another? vi.) Are there circumstances in which paternalism is permissible or even required?After a couple of introductory sessions in which we set up the economic, sociological and anthropological background of the main concerns of this set of issues (to the extent that there is a solid body of evidence on these matters) we will move on to consider the following topics:290-6 
Graduate Seminar: Logic, Epistemology, and Natural Language.
Yalcin.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses.
We will cover some recent work on topics at the intersection of the philosophy of
language, philosophical logic, and epistemology.We will begin by considering the role of logical notions in natural language
semantics. After a review of recent work highlighting some of the nontrivial
differences between natural language and classical logic, we will ask: in what sense
does natural language have a logic? We’ll then turn to the question how the notion
of logic appropriate to natural language relates to the notion of traditional
epistemological concern. When epistemologists speak of logic as normatively
constraining belief, do they have in mind the same notion of logic? If not, how are
the notions related?In the second part of the course, we will turn to the relationship between logic and
belief, and to the related issue of how to model belief. First, what are the demands
of logic on belief? How should these demands be understood if we represent belief as
coming in degrees—that is, if we speak of credence instead? Second, what
metaphysical picture is appropriate to such a representation of belief? Is credence
in the head?In the third part of the course, we will turn to some debates about knowledge that
have been thought to depend partly on issues about natural language. The two main
questions will be these: First, how are knowledge and credence each related to
rational action? Second, is knowledge a state which is somehow relative to a
question, or to an inquiry, and if so, what is the upshot of this for questions of
traditional epistemological concern?Readings will come from Harman, Hawthorne, Stanley, Sturgeon, Rothschild, Leslie,
Christensen, Moss, and Yalcin, among others.295

Nature of Mind.
Lee.
MWF 11-12,
159 Mulford.
This course will be an introduction to some of the major debates in 
Philosophy of Mind. Is consciousness a purely physical phenomenon? Is 
the brain a computer and the mind its software? Are our common-sense 
ideas about how to explain people’s behavior compatible with 
contemporary scientific views about the structure of the brain? How can 
the mind represent the external world?4 
Knowledge & its Limits.
Roush.
TuTh 11-12:30,
155 Donner.
In this course we think about knowledge: How do we know we’re not in a 
Matrix? Is our knowledge built on a foundation or are we floating on a 
raft, or does our knowledge have the structure of a teepee? What are the 
requirements for knowledge? How much do we need to trust others in order 
to know? Can we trust ourselves? Can conspiracy theories ever be 
justified? Do animals have knowledge?7 
Existentialism in Literature & Film.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 3:30-5,
159 Mulford.
In the traditional Judeo/Christian understanding, God is the
ground of all meaning.  At the end of the Medieval World, Descartes
and Kant attempt to promote Man as an autonomous ground, taking the
traditional place of God.  The promotion of man undermines the
authority of God, but as an autonomous ground Man turns out to be
existentially insufficient.  The dual failure of God and Man as
ground, leaves us with the threat of nihilism.  The course asks:
Can we preserve the existential insight common to both traditions
that life needs some kind of ground, without finding such a ground
in a Supreme Being or in autonomous Man?The answer depends upon whether one can uncover an authority
other than us that, although not a Supreme Being, nevertheless
serves as a ground.  The course will be devoted to a series of
philosophical-religious thinkers who describe just such a
possibility.  Pascal speaks of God as essentially hidden and makes
a virtue of his hiddenness.  Kierkegaard holds that after the
God-man appears in the world we no longer have, nor do we need,
access to God the Father.  Nietzsche embraces as liberating the
sheer absence of any ground.  In opposition, Dostoyevsky attempts
to show how one can live a meaningful life that preserves the
authority of our Judeo-Christian practices without recourse to a
monotheistic metaphysics.Required Reading:   Dostoevsky, Brothers Karamazov (Dover)

This course is intended to introduce the student to the concepts and 
principles of deductive logic: symbolizing English language sentences 
and arguments in terms of formalized languages; validity, implication, 
and equivalence in truth-functional and quantificational logic; systems 
of deduction, and their soundness and completeness. In addition to the 
three lectures, each student will attend two sections per week.Requirements: Lecture and section attendance, weekly problem sets,

Freshman Seminar: Philosophy with Socrates.
Corcilius.
W 11-12,
214 Haviland.
In this seminar we will jointly read and discuss a series of ancient texts in which the Greek philosopher Socrates examines other people’s claims about pleasure, justice, piety, virtue, the good life, death, happiness, philosophy and many other important things. We will learn about the so-called Socratic Method, about its aims and structure and discuss the issues raised by Socrates for ourselves.  Professor Klaus Corcilius’ interest is in ancient philosophy, theoretical and practical, and within ancient philosophy especially Aristotle. Currently, he is working on Aristotle’s scientific conception of the soul. Corcilius was an undergraduate at Hamburg University, Germany, and completed his doctoral studies at Humboldt Universität Berlin.25B

History of Political Philosophy.
Kolodny.
MWF 10-11,
155 Kroeber.
Please note:  As taught this semester Phil 114 
 will satisfy the ethics requirement.Political science seeks to describe, explain, and predict political 
phenomena. These questions must be settled empirically: by consulting 
history, observing differences between countries, conducting 
statistical studies, and so on. Political philosophy asks different 
questions, which it is less clear that we can settle empirically. 
Some of these questions are conceptual. What makes a particular form 
of human interaction political? Other questions are normative. What 
sort of government should we have? How should we, as individuals, 
relate to it?This course will survey some major works of political philosophy of 
the 17th-19th centuries.  More specifically, we will read several, 
but not all, of the following authors: Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, 
 Hume, Bentham, Mill, Kant, Hegel, and Marx.  The selection remains to 
be determined.The course will be more interpretive than many philosophy classes. 
Although we may hope to learn something about the questions that 
interest us, we will be discussing, in the first instance, the 
questions that interested the authors. Furthermore, our 
 interpretations will have a different focus from courses on the same 
texts in other departments. There will be greater emphasis on 
normative foundations than on institutional design, and greater 
emphasis on the internal logical structure of the arguments than on 
their author’s rhetoric or immediate political aims. For this reason, 
some experience with philosophical reasoning is essential.125 
Metaphysics.
Lee.
MWF 3-4,
180 Tan.
This course will be a survey of some ongoing debates in metaphysics. 
Questions we will consider will include: Why does the universe exist? Is 
time’s passage an illusion? Is space a container and the world its 
contents? What is it for an object to exist at more than one time? Do 
other possible worlds exist?128 
Philosophy of Science.
Skokowski.
TuTh 11-12:30,

This course is an intermediate level introduction to problems in
philosophy of science through readings of primary sources. We will
examine several movements in recent philosophy of science ranging from
logical positivism to realism and anti-realism about scientific theories
and entities. We will also examine philosophical problems in specific
sciences, including, for example, physics. A scientific or technical
background is not required - just a philosophical curiosity about science.132

Theory of Meaning.
Campbell.
MWF 2-3,
110 Barrows.
This course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular 
the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our 
ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a 
matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we 
take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in 
the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought 
set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and 
Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the 
contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later 
Wittgenstein. We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege 
and Russell. Prerequisite: two previous courses in philosophy.140B 
Intermediate Logic.
Mancosu.
MWF 11-12,
110 Wheeler.
This course covers the most important metalogical results that are of 
interest to philosophers. It is divided into three parts. The first two 
parts are mathematical in style whereas the last part is philosophical. 
In the first part we will cover the basic notions of computability 
theory and study in detail the Turing machine approach to computability. 
The second part of the course will give a detailed presentation of 
Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and related results. Finally, we will 
look at the philosophical relevance of these logical results to various 
areas of philosophy.Prerequisite: 12A (or equivalent) or permission from the instructor.Course requirements: exercise sets approximately every ten days 
(counting for 60% of final grade) and a philosophical paper due at the 
end of the semester (40% of final grade).160 
Plato.
Corcilius.
TuTh 11-12:30,

In this course we will examine the main currents within Plato’s philosophy. This will include his conceptions of philosophy, the good life, the soul, causes and explanation, the hypothesis of the Forms, his account of human knowledge and some of the later developments and revisions of these conceptions. The focus will lie on Plato’s Dialogues Euthyphro, Republic, Meno, Phaedo, Symposium, Phaedrus, Parmenides, Sophist and Philebus.
The discussion will focus largely on Plato’s texts. Important secondary literature will be made available on bspace. No previous knowledge of Plato required.

Crockett.
MWF 3-4,
262 Dwinelle.
This course will be a detailed examination of several central works of 
the 17th century philosopher G.W. Leibniz, with an emphasis on his 
metaphysical views.Topics will include Leibniz’s views on the relation 
between mind and body, the nature of space and time, the relation 
between our representations of the world and the world as it is in 
itself, the nature of substance and material reality, the relation 
between God and creation, the nature of inter- and intra-substantial 
causality, and the unity of organic entities.Enrollment in the class is limited to 20 and is restricted to philosophy 
majors who have had PHIL 25B or an equivalent course.183 
Schopenhauer & Nietzsche.
Kaiser.
TuTh 2-3:30,
20 Wheeler.
Schopenhauer’s pessimism and Nietzsche’s forceful ‘affirmation of life’ seem to be worlds apart from each other.  On closer analysis though, the two philosophies are interestingly related. In addition, many of Nietzsche’s central theses can be understood properly only against the background of  Schopenhauer’s thought.The course offers a systematic comparative study of both philosophers’ interpretations of life (or existence). Particular attention will be paid to the role of art and the function of aesthetic experience in their accounts of life. Other topics to be discussed include nihilism, the nature of the will and the drives (instincts), and the relation between the rational intellect and the bodily self. Readings will include selections from Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation and central texts by Nietzsche from the different phases of his philosophy. Enrollment by instructor’s approval only. Students who would like to enroll should write a brief email to the instructor (at kuk@berkeley.edu) detailing their background in philosophy and their interest in the course. 187 
Topics in the History of Philosophy: Kant’s aesthetics.
Ginsborg.
W 2-5,
233 Dwinelle.
We will discuss Kant’s aesthetic theory, focussing primarily on his
theory of the beautiful.  We will be concerned both with the theory in
its own right, and with its broader philosophical implications.
Readings will be drawn mostly from the Critique of Judgment, with some
background material and some secondary readings; we may also read some
contemporary aesthetic theory.  Choice of readings will to some extent
be determined by the interests of the students participating.  The
class will be conducted as a seminar, and participants will be
expected to participate actively in discussion.  Requirements will
include several short writing assignments and a long final paper;
participation in class discussion will be taken into account in
determining the final grade.Enrollment in the class is limited to 15 and is by application only.
To apply to enroll, you should send an email  (with “Philosophy 187
Application” in the subject line) to the instructor at
ginsborg@berkeley.edu with a brief description of your reasons for
wishing to take the course and a description of your background in
philosophy, including, but not necessarily limited to, a list of
philosophy courses already taken and the corresponding grades.
Participants will be expected to have a substantial background in
philosophy.  Preference will be given to philosophy majors, and,
within that group, to seniors.  The deadline is Friday Dec 9.  If your
application is accepted, you will receive a course enrollment code by
email before the end of December.189 
Topics in Recent European Philosophy: Foucault.
Sluga.
TuTh 12:30-2,
60 Evans.
The course will focus exclusively on the work of Michel Foucault.  Foucault himself has repeatedly described his thinking as passing from a concern with knowledge to one with power and finally to one with the subject.  The course will examine the evolution of Foucault’s thinking through these three phases.290-1

Graduate Seminar: Promises and Promissory Obligation.
Kolodny/Wallace.
M 12-2,
234 Moses.
Promises are ubiquitous phenomena that greatly facilitate human social life, but they are also philosophically elusive. Promising can be understood as a device for generating new obligations where there were none before, a device whose operations help us to coordinate our activities and to make effective plans for the future. But how exactly do promises function? Do promissory obligations result from our participation in beneficial social practices, or do they derive instead from the effects of the promise on the attitudes of the promisee? Can promises be binding even if nobody expects you to fulfill them? Promises seem to involve obligations that are directional, insofar as they are owed specifically to the promisee; but is this an idea that we can make good sense of? How do promises function in the law (what is the relation between promises and contracts?), and in the context of intimate personal relationships? What human interests ultimately ground the kind of “normative powers” that promising confers on agents?The seminar will involve close study of some of the most important contributions to the extensive contemporary literature on promising. Philosophers whose works will be discussed include Raz, Scanlon, Thomson, Shiffrin, and Owens (among others).290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Probability in Epistemology.
Roush.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses.
This is a course about the use of probability in epistemology. Probability imports assumptions about and imposes constraints on any subject matter you use it to describe. Some of these constraints are well-known, but their implications are not always known or observed. In others it is an open question how much leeway probability allows. We discuss the fate of holism, foundationalism, empiricism, introspective access, self-knowledge, belief in logical truth, and closure of knowledge under known implication. under a probabilistic description. We consider the consequences of the globality of the P function and of extreme probabilities. We discuss artifacts of representation and how to think about idealization in philosophy. Idealizations are false models, so how can one be better than another, or any of them illuminating?290-4 
Graduate Seminar: The Intentionality of Perceptual Experience.
Searle.
Th 11-1,
234 Moses.
I think many, indeed most, of the philosophic confusions about perception come from a failure to understand the intentionality of perceptual experience.  Many philosophers deny that perception has intentionality, and even those who accept it tend to give a false account of the intentionality.  A correct account will not only enable us to give an adequate account of perceptual experiences but to refute the standard mistakes in the field, such as phenomenalism, the representative theory, disjunctivism, etc.
     This subject obviously opens up into a whole lot of related subjects in epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind, and I intend to pursue several of those.290-5

A beginning exploration of some interrelated questions concerning the conditions of propositional thought: understanding, a capacity for judgement and for believing and doing things for reasons, and how knowledge of what is so and one’s knowledge of oneself are or are not involved in the competent exercise of such capacities.290-7 
Graduate Seminar: Kant’s Transcendental Deduction.
Warren.
F 2-4,
234 Moses.
We will discuss some of the central themes of Kant’s metaphysics and epistemology by closely examining the argument of the “Transcendental Deduction of the Categories” and related texts in the Critique of Pure Reason and the Prolegomena, as well as some of the relevant secondary literature.  The topics in Kant that I plan to cover include consciousness and apperception, the unity of the self, the character of conceptual representation, the notions of a category, of judgment, and of the form of a judgment, and the concept of an object.295

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Scharding.
MTuWTh 10-12,
229 Dwinelle.
What do we owe each other?  What do we owe ourselves?  What happens when these obligations conflict?  An introduction to moral and political philosophy, the course considers some of the ethical controversies associated with our racially, economically, and culturally diverse contemporary societies, including: the ethics of multiculturalism, feminism, and affirmative action; the regulation of hate speech; how to meet the needs of extremely poor people; and the nature of tolerance.  Readings are drawn from contemporary philosophy and include works by Peter Singer, Bernard Williams, T.M. Scanlon, G.A. Cohen, and Susan Wolf.3 
Nature of Mind.
Winzeler.
MTuWTh 12-2,
215 Dwinelle.
This course is an introduction to the philosophical study of the mind. We
will start off by investigating the Mind-Body problem: that is, how
exactly are the mind and body related to one another? Are they two wholly
separate things? Or is the mind just identical to the brain?
Alternatively, the mind might just be a computer program, with the
implication that machines could be capable of thought and other mental
states. We will study the strong and weak points of all of these theories:
Dualism, Identity Theory, Behaviorism and Functionalism. We will go on to
look at the phenomenon of consciousness. We will ask: what is
consciousness? Can we describe it scientifically? What is special about
the conscious states that we refer to as “emotions”? We will end the
course by studying how we should regard the content of our mental states.
In essence, we will try to see if content is internally or externally
determined. How much does the environment in which we are placed get into
our heads? Again, the overarching theme and goal of this question, as well
as all the others, will be a deeper understanding of how our minds and the
physical world around us are related.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Misenheimer.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
100 Wheeler.
When you encounter (or assert) a conclusion that is supposed to follow
from some premises, it is often helpful to know why (and whether) the
conclusion really does follow from the premises—why (and whether) the
argument with that conclusion and those premises is valid. In this
course, you will develop the skills to tell, for many different
arguments, why the conclusion does or does not follow from the premises.
In particular, you will learn how to translate many arguments in English
into a formal language (such as the Language of Sentential Logic or the
Language of First-Order Logic), how to test whether some of those
arguments are valid (for example, using truth tables for arguments in
the Language of Sentential Logic), and how to demonstrate the validity
(by constructing a proof in a natural deduction system) or invalidity
(by constructing a counterexample) of any argument in one of our formal
languages.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
de Harven.
MTuWTh 10-12,
156 Dwinelle.
This course is designed as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally, and to ancient philosophy in particular.  Those new to philosophy will learn the landscape by reading and writing about knowledge (epistemology), the nature of reality (metaphysics), psychology, philosophy of mind, politics, and ethics as the ancients saw it.  Those with experience in philosophy will get acquainted both with the striking differences between ancient and modern thinkers and the very elements that make the Greeks foundational to Western philosophy. The ancient perspective is an excellent starting point for its accessibility to the newcomer and inextricable relation to ongoing philosophical debates.  The course will focus on Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, with smaller selections from the presocratics and the Hellenistic era.  25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Sethi.
MTuWTh 12-2,
209 Dwinelle.
This course will survey the ideas of five important philosophers of
the 17th and 18th century – Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and
Kant. We will consider how they pose and develop responses to
important metaphysical and epistemological questions that form the
basis of some of the main concerns of modern philosophy. These include
questions about the nature of reality (Does God exist? What is the
nature of the human mind? How does the mind relate to the body? Are
there causal connections in the world?), as well as the relation
between us and the world (What do we perceive? Can we come to know
things about the world through perception? Are there things we can
know to be true through reason alone? Are there limits on what we can
know?) We will attempt to develop a historical understanding of the
connections across the views we consider, as well as to
philosophically engage with and respond to each in its own right.128

Chinese Philosophy.
Tiwald.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
229 Dwinelle.
This course will introduce students to the major schools of philosophy in
classical China, including Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism.
Although the course is meant primarily as a survey of the most important
Chinese thinkers, a prominent theme will be their views on moral
cultivation and moral agency. Philosophers of this era were greatly
interested in the development of good character and the key features of
proper moral knowledge and motivation. All Chinese texts will be in
translation.161 
Aristotle.
Corcilius.
TuWTh 3:30-6,
100 Wheeler.
This course is an intermediate level introduction into Aristotle’s philosophy. The course consists of an examination of Aristotle’s main philosophical writings. It will cover parts of his logic, his philosophy of nature, his practical philosophy and his metaphysics, with an emphasis on his practical philosophy. Required text: A New Aristotle Reader, ed. J. L. Ackrill, 1987. Recommended text: The Complete Works of Aristotle, ed. J. Barnes 2 vol. 1984 (or later).

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Carey.
MTuWTh 12-2,
215 Dwinelle.
This course will be a broad introduction to some of the important issues in moral and political philosophy.  We will address central questions in each of the three major subject areas of ethics.  We will start with metaethics, and ask questions about the nature of morality.  For example: Is there any such thing as moral truth, or are all moral statements only personally or culturally relative?  Then we will discuss questions in normative ethics about the content of morality: What makes right actions right?  How do our various duties relate to one another (for example, is there only one supreme duty, from which all the others can be derived)?  Finally, we will address some of the more explicitly practical questions in applied ethics.  For example: What are our duties to those suffering from famine in far-off lands?  Is abortion ever morally permissible?  How should we treat non-human animals; for example, can we permissibly eat them?12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Fusco.
TuWTh 1-3:30,

Introduction to logic, using Forbes’ Modern Logic textbook.  We’ll cover
propositional and predicate calculus, with an emphasis on proofs.  This
course counts towards fulfillment of the logic requirement for philosophy
majors.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Barnes.
MTuWTh 12-2,
109 Dwinelle.
How should you live your life?  In the course of trying to answer that
question, Socrates
unearthed a number of enduring philosophical problems.  In this class
we will look at some
of those problems in their original context, with an eye to
understanding not only what the
problems are, and why they arose, but also why many of them persist.
Readings will be
drawn from Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and the Stoics.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Crawford.
MTuWTh 10-12,
229 Dwinelle.
This course provides a survey of some of the works of six major figures
central to the development of philosophical thought in the early modern
period: Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. We will study
their work in the areas of metaphysics and epistemology and trace the
development of particular philosophical problems and insights through each
figure. Some of the questions we will be considering throughout the course
are: What is the mind, and what is its relation to the body? What is God?
What does perception reveal, and what are its limits? What can we know
through reason alone? We will consider these and other questions, and how
they were approached, both within their historical contexts and as they
stand on their own.115 
Political Philosophy.
Grosser.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
209 Dwinelle.
This introductory class will examine the works of four classical protagonists of Western political thought – Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, and John Rawls. It is meant to provide students with a basic understanding of paradigmatic ancient, modern, and contemporary political theories: An understanding of the respective metaphysical and ontological, rationalist and contractarian approaches that essentially inform these theories; of the underlying anthropological assumptions; of the relevance and specific meaning of concepts such as justice, freedom, or power; and, most importantly, of differing argumentative strategies of justifying the existence of the state philosophically. Thus, based on a careful reading of their politico-philosophical writings, it is to be considered how Plato and Aristotle, Hobbes and Rawls aim at finding a balance that resolves the inescapable tension between (stately) authority and (individual) autonomy. Additionally, the course aims at identifying the concepts of the political that, implicitly or explicitly, organize the political theories discussed.125 
Metaphysics.
Giberman.
TuWTh 3:30-6,
215 Dwinelle.
This course is a survey of issues central to contemporary metaphysics.
Topics covered include ontology, meta-ontology, universals, tropes, bare
particulars, bundle theory, nominalism, parthood, time, persistence,
personal identity, modality, causation, laws, and fundamentality. Readings
mostly span from the mid twentieth century to the present.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Flanagan.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
103 Moffitt.
Humans, and possibly certain other creatures, are conscious. Life would
have no personal meaning, it wouldn’t matter one bit (to each of us
individually, at any rate), if it were not for consciousness. But what is
consciousness? Does possession of consciousness require possession of a
non-physical soul or does mind = brain in which case it will eventually be
explained by neuroscience? Did some deity endow us with consciousness or
is consciousness just one quirky outcome of the blind force of evolution
by natural selection? Does my possession of a mind equip me with a free
will that allows for personal responsibility, as well as blame and praise,
for my actions? If my mind is just my brain then in what sense, am I free
— the brain after all is just a 3 lb. piece of tissue and biology is
thought to be governed by natural laws. Indeed, some have suggested that
the idea of free will is an illusion.The course will introduce students to the main problems in the philosophy
of mind: the nature of consciousness, the mind-body relation, free-will
vs. determinism, the nature of personal identity. Nothing less that the
meaning of life and the nature of morality rest on our understanding of
our minds. No prior background in philosophy is required. Students
interested in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, medicine, religion,
and law will find much to interest them.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California3 
Nature of Mind.
Campbell.
MWF 12-1,
50 Birge.
In this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.7 
Existentialism in Literature and Film.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 3:30-5,
145 Dwinelle.
The course will be organized around various attempts to reinterpret the Judeo/Christian God, and to determine in what sense, if at all, such a God is still a living God.  We will study Dostoyevsky’s and Kierkegaard’s attempts to preserve a non-theological version of the God of Christianity, as well as Nietzche’s attempt to save us from belief in any version of God offered by our tradition.  We will view and discuss three films that deal with related issues.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Warren.
MWF 1-2,
2040 Valley.
This course is intended to introduce the student to the concepts and principles of deductive logic:  symbolizing English language sentences and arguments in terms of formalized languages; validity, implication, and equivalence in truth-functional and quantificational logic; systems of deduction, and their soundness and completeness.  In addition to the three lectures, each student will attend two sections per week.  Requirements:  Lecture and section attendance, weekly problem sets, several in-section quizzes, a midterm and a final.Text: Warren Goldfarb’s Deductive Logic , Hackett, 2003.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Ginsborg.
MWF 11-12,
10 Evans.
The course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological views of five important early modern philosophers:  Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant.  We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics.  We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century.  But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right.  The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.100 
Philosophical Methods.
Hoffman.
W 2-4,

The course is designed to acquaint students with the techniques of philosophical reasoning through detailed study of selected philosophical texts and through extensive training in philosophical writing, based on those texts. Restricted to students in the major109 
Freedom and Responsibility.
Vargas.
TuTh 9:30-11,
110 Wheeler.
Examination of the nature of free will and moral responsibility. Topics may include: whether free will is incompatible with determinism, various conceptions of free will, the empirical evidence for and against these conceptions, the justification of moral responsibility, the status of various forms of impaired agency (e.g., psychopathy, addiction), and the relationship of moral responsibility to normative ethical theories.125 
Metaphysics.
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,
3108 Etcheverry.
A wide-ranging lecture-and-discussion course on the nature and prospects of a Kantian or “transcendental” metaphysical investigation of the necessary conditions of the possibility of human thought and experience.  Can some such conditions be discovered, and can metaphysical conclusions about how the world is or must be drawn from them?  Particular topics to be explored in this setting include: the problem of metaphysics, the independence of physical objects, the objectivity of causal modality, mind and body, persons and first-person thought, self-consciousness and thought of an objective world, conditions of the attribution of psychological attitudes, agency and the attribution of value, perceptions of colour and the colours of objects.  Familiarity with the history of modern philosophy, especially the philosophy of Kant, is recommended.  Required course work includes extensive reading of sometimes difficult material and careful writing of focused critical papers.  Not for beginners in philosophy.A reader containing required and supplementary readings will be available.

Philosophical Logic.
MacFarlane.
TuTh 12:30-2,
30 Wheeler.
An introduction to the philosophy of logic and to philosophical applications of logic.  The bulk of the course will be devoted to discussion of two notions that play a central role in logical theory: truth and logical consequence.  We will pay special attention to the philosophical significance of Tarski’s formal definitions of both notions.  At the end of the course we will consider how logical theory can be brought to bear on philosophical problems, focusing on the sorites paradox (or “paradox of the heap”).  Topics to be covered include theories of truth, facts and propositions, the slingshot argument, Tarski’s truth definitions, objectual and substitutional quantification, proof-theoretic and model-theoretic definitions of logical consequence, relevance logics, dialetheism, the sorites paradox, many-valued logics, and supervaluations.Prerequisites:  Philosophy 12A (or equivalent) and at least one other course in philosophy.  The course covers some technical material, but knowledge of logic beyond what is taught in 12A will not be  presupposed.Requirements will include both papers and occasional problem sets.Books: John Etchemendy, The Concept of Logical Consequence (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1990); course reader.146 
Philosophy of Mathematics.
Mancosu.
TuTh 9:30-11,
200 Wheeler.
This is an introduction to the classics of philosophy of mathematics with emphasis on the debates on the foundations of mathematics. Topics to be covered: infinitist theorems in seventeenth century mathematics; the foundations of the Leibnizian differential calculus and Berkeley’s ‘Analyst’; Kant on pure intuition in arithmetic and geometry; the arithmetization of analysis (Bolzano, Dedekind); Frege’s logicism; the emergence of Cantorian set theory; Zermelo’s axiomatization of set theory; Hilbert’s program; Russell’s logicism; Brouwer’s intuitionism; Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.Prerequisites: Phil 12A or equivalent.170 
Descartes.
Hoffman.
MWF 10-11,
126 Barrows.
This course will focus on a close reading of Descartes’ most important work: his Meditations.  We will, however, begin with readings from the earlier Discourse and occasionally draw upon his other works and extensive correspondence.  Topics will include skepticism and our knowledge of our self, God and the world, the mind and its relation to the body, the roles of the senses and the intellect, and the relation between Descartes’ scientific and philosophical projects.  We will also take up some of the more specific issues for which Descartes’ discussion was to frame later philosophical debates, e.g., perception and the theory of ideas, the distinction between primary and secondary qualities, and the nature of space.  Depending upon time and interest, we may close by considering interpretive debates surrounding Descartes among his successor “Cartesians,” especially the vitriolic exchange between Malebranche and Arnauld.READINGS:

In The Will to Power, Nietzsche speaks of Schopenhauer as his most important precursor adding that he has deepened Schopenhauer pessimism and “by devising its extremist antithesis first really experienced it.”  In this course I propose to examine Schopenhauer’s and Nietzsche’s metaphysical, epistemological, and moral doctrines with a view to their similarities and differences.READINGS:

We will begin by quickly going through the “Monadology,” which gives an overview of Leibniz’s philosophical system. The rest of the seminar will focus mostly on the New Essays on Human Understanding, a work in which Leibniz presents his philosophical views on the philosophy of mind, epistemology, and metaphysics, in a detailed response to Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding. We will be especially interested in Leibniz’s views about knowledge and representation, and in the significance, for the development of Kant’s thought, of Leibniz’s complex and interconnected views about apperception, perception, concepts, thought, reflection, memory, and innate ideas.Required Texts:

Concepts.
Ginsborg.
W 2-4,

We will read some recent work on concepts, focussing especially on Fodor and his critique of “pragmatic” views of concept-possession.  We will be concerned in particular with the question of how (or indeed whether) concepts can be acquired on the basis of experience.   We will also consider the related question of whether perceptual experience has nonconceptual content.290-3 
Practical Necessities.
Wallace.
M 2-4,
234 Moses.
The normative reasons at the center of moral life have distinctive features that encourage us to think of them as sources of practical necessity. In this seminar we will look at three different ideas that contribute to this sense of the special rational force of moral considerations: inescapability (the idea that morality provides reasons to all agents, without regard to their special preferences and tastes and interests); deontic structure (the sense that moral considerations enter the deliberative field, as it were, in the guise of requirements); and importance (the idea that moral reasons are significant enough to prevail against the kinds of personal consideration with which they might come into conflict). Readings will be drawn from the contemporary literature on morality, normativity, and practical reason, including some work in progress by the instructor.290-4 
Predicativity.
Mancosu.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses.
The foundational program known as “predicativity” took its start from the debate between Poincaré and Russell on the nature of logic and received already in 1918 an impressive formulation and systematization in Weyl’s The Continuum. By the 1950s the logical tools required for a logical analysis of the notion had been developed. In the last two decades reflection on predicativity has prospered not only from the foundational point of view but also from the philosophical point of view. Recent work by, among others, Parsons, Burgess, Wright, Dummett, Feferman, and Hellman has revived the discussion on predicativity and its connections to issues such as neologicism, indispensability arguments etc. In the seminar we will begin by looking at the classical positions by Poincaré and Weyl and after a brief interlude on the logical characterization of predicativity given by Feferman and Schütte in the sixties we will focus on some of the most recent philosophical discussions mentioned above.290-5 
Brandom’s Making It Explicit.
MacFarlane.
Tu 5-7,

We will read Bob Brandom’s 1994 book Making It Explicit:  Reasoning, Representing, and Discursive Commitment, with the aim of understanding and evaluating its sophisticated version of a “use theory of meaning.”Books:  Robert Brandom, Making It Explicit: Reasoning, Representing, and Discursive Commitment (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1994).290-6 
Language and Consciousness.
Searle.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses.
The subject of the seminar will be Language and Consciousness.  I want to approach a series of traditional problems in the Philosophy of Language from a new angle.  I want to adopt a more “naturalistic” approach than I have done in my published work or than is common in the tradition of the Philosophy of Language.  I want to develop the idea that we can explain a lot of features of language by developing the idea that language evolves as an extension of more biologically primitive forms of intentionality in perception, action and consciousness generally.  The structure of the proposition, and particularly the unity of the proposition as well as the use of language to create a social and institutional reality have, I believe, profound biological bases.I want to begin the seminar with these issues and then branch out further into questions about consciousness generally and other problems in the philosophy of language.290-7

Ancient Philosophy.
Corcilius.
MWF 12-1,

This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. It provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek philosophical thinking from the pre-Socratic beginnings to the hellenistic period. The bulk of the course will be spent on the analysis of the philosophical motives, methods and views of Socrates (469 – 399 BC), Plato (427-347 BC), and Aristotle (384-322 BC). Since the ancient Greeks identified many of the philosophical problems (and models for their resolution) we are still concerned with today, the course may also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally.39M 
Freshman&Sophomore Seminar: Free Will.
Clarke.
W 2-5,
206 Wheeler.
This seminar is an introduction to the problem of free will, i.e. the problem of how to justify our belief that we are free to choose between alternative courses of action. In the first half of the semester we will look at the history of the problem, paying special attention to its origins in antiquity. In the second half of the semester we will turn to the lively contemporary debate. Questions to be considered include: When and why did concerns about free will emerge? What does free will consist in? Is it possible for us to act freely if our behavior is determined by factors beyond our control? Is human freedom compatible with the existence of an omniscient God? What is the relation of free will to moral responsibility and to ethics?100

THIS COURSE IS RESTRICTED TO PHILOSOPHY MAJORS. It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy. Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills. This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the problem of personal identity. There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading. In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper.Text: Personal Identity, edited by John Perry, University of California Press108 
Contemporary Ethical Issues.
Kolodny.
TuTh 9:30-11,
220 Wheeler.
Note:  As taught this semester, Philosophy 108 will satisfy the Ethics requirement.As a thoughtful person, living in this country, at this time, you have at some point asked yourself some of the following questions.
Should torture be allowed? Is there any difference between terrorism and “collateral damage”? May we kill enemy soldiers or even civilians to protect ourselves? Is capital punishment moral? Is abortion? Whether or not it’s moral, should it be legal? Should we let the majority or the courts decide? Is the government allowed to take your money and use it in ways you don’t want? If you have better grades and higher test scores, do you deserve a spot at UC more? Are you allowed to buy yourself an iPod when you could use the money to save people from starving? Should you buy a hybrid, rather than an SUV, when your individual choice is just “a drop in the bucket” and won’t really affect global warming?These questions can be difficult for many different reasons. Self- interest, prejudice, and fear can cloud our judgment. Religious authorities that we accept on faith, such as the Bible, can give unclear or conflicting directions. Finally, it can be hard to be sure of relevant facts: for example, whether information gained through torture tends to be reliable, whether the justice system applies the death penalty consistently, or whether burning fossil fuels leads to climate change.This course, however, is about another set of difficulties, which persist when we set aside our personal feelings, we see how far we can get without relying on faith, and we assume that we know the relevant facts. We may not be able to decide, by our own reflection and reasoning, which answers are correct, and even when we are sure that certain answers are correct, we may not be able to justify them. Our ethical ideas may seem not up to the task. Our aim in this course is to come to terms with these difficulties and to see to what extent they can be overcome.115 
Political Philosophy.

Feminism & Philosophy.
Madva.
TuTh 9:30-11,
201 Wheeler.
Is there an essential difference between women and men?  If so, what is the nature of this difference and what are its moral, social, and political implications?  If not, what explains the apparent differences?  How do considerations of race, class, religion, and nationality speak to these questions?  Can a psychological account of how we tend to sort people into distinct social categories illuminate how we understand these categories?  Can assumptions about gender compromise the science of gender and sex, or scientific objectivity in general?  This course introduces philosophy students to these and related questions in feminist thought, concluding with analyses of a few specific debates in contemporary feminist epistemology, ethics, and metaphysics.Required Readings:All other readings and assigned material will be available on bSpace.Course Grading and Requirements: Participation (20%); Papers (80%)Attendance & Participation (20%): This includes attendance, participation, and pop quizzes.  Attendance is mandatory, as is arriving on time.  Excused absences require signed documentation from a doctor or dean.  Participation and preparation are crucial.  There are a variety of ways to participate, including: actively contributing to discussions, demonstrating reflection on the readings, listening carefully to others’ contributions (which includes not dominating discussion), showing respect toward classmates, and talking with me during office hours.  There will also be a number of pop quizzes to make sure students are keeping up with the assignments.3 Papers: 1st: 3 pages (15%); 2nd: 5-7 pages (30%); 3rd: 5-7 pages (35%)132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Martin.
MWF 11-12,
20 Barrows.
From the earliest point in our lives we mark a distinction between the
social world of animate beings and the inanimate objects about us. The
distinctions we make are fundamental to our ways of finding out about the
world and responding to what we discover there. But do the distinctions we
mark reflect ultimate differences in the nature of the world around us?
These are the questions addressed in this course. We will be looking at
some of the oldest and most fundamental questions about the mind: the
nature of consciousness, knowledge of our own minds and of others’;
physicalism and dualism; functionalism.135 
Theory of Meaning.
Campbell.
MWF 10-11,
213 Wheeler.
This course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein. We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege and Russell. Prerequisite: two previous courses in philosophy.136 
Philosophy of Perception.
Noë.
TuTh 12:30-2,
100 Wheeler.
The philosophy of perception is a microcosm of the metaphysics of mind. Its central problems – What is perception? What is the nature of perceptual consciousness? How can one fit an account of perceptual experience into a broader account of the nature of the mind and the world? – are problems at the heart of metaphysics. It is often justifiably said that the theory of perception (and especially vision) is the area of psychology and neuroscience that has made the greatest progress in recent years. Despite this progress, or perhaps because of it, philosophical problems about perception retain a great urgency, both for philosophy and for science.143 
Modal Reasoning.
Holliday.
TuTh 2-3:30,
123 Wheeler.
An introduction to the logical study of modality in its many forms:
reasoning about necessity, knowledge, obligation, time, counterfactuals,
provability, and other modal notions. Covers core concepts and basic
metatheory of propositional modal logic, including relations to
first-order logic; basics of quantified modal logic; selected
philosophical applications ranging from epistemology to ethics,
metaphysics to mathematics.Prerequisite: 12A (or equivalent) or consent of instructor.156A 
Foundations of Analytic Philosophy: Frege.
Sluga.
MWF 1-2,

Note:  As taught this semester, Philosophy 156A can count towards the 160-187 History requirement (not the 160-178 requirement).160 
Plato.
Corcilius.
MWF 3-4,
213 Wheeler.
In this course we will examine the main currents within Plato’s philosophy. This will include his conceptions of philosophy, the good life, the soul, causes and explanation, the hypothesis of the Forms, his account of human knowledge and some of the later developments and revisions of these conceptions. The focus will lie on Plato’s Dialogues Euthyphro, Republic, Meno, Phaedo, Symposium, Phaedrus, Parmenides, Sophist and Philebus. The discussion will focus largely on Plato’s texts. Important secondary literature will be made available on bspace. No previous knowledge of Plato required. Required text: Plato. Complete Works. Ed. J. M. Cooper Indianapolis 1997. Hackett Publishing Company. ISBN 0–87220–349–2172 
Spinoza.
Crockett.
TuTh 12:30-2,
210 Wheeler.
This course is a close examination of the structure of Spinoza’s philosophical system.  Most of our time will be spend on a careful reading of Spinoza’s Ethics Demonstrated in Geometric Order, in which Spinoza argues for a comprehensive philosophical system that encompasses metaphysics, epistemology, psychology and ethics.  Our primary goal will be to come to an understanding of Spinoza’s philosophical views, the relation of these views to those of his contemporaries, and the relevance of his views to contemporary philosophical theories.  178 
Kant.
Warren.
TuTh 2-3:30,
110 Wheeler.
In this course we will examine some of the major metaphysical and epistemological themes of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. We will be focusing particularly on Kant’s views on the following topics: a priori knowledge and how it is possible, space and time, objectivity and experience, self-knowledge, and transcendental idealism and the contrast between appearances and things in themselves. Several short papers and two longer papers will be required.Prerequisite: Philosophy 25 [History of Modern Philosophy (17th&18th centuries)]Texts: Required: Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, transl’d by Norman Kemp Smith; Kant, Prolegomena, transl’d by Gary Hatfield;
Recommended: Henry Allison, Kant’s Transcendental Idealism 2nd ed’n (Yale Univ. Press, 2004mm189 
Topics in Recent European Philosophy: Heidegger.
Kaiser.
TuTh 11-12:30,
234 Moses.
Note:  As taught this semester, Philosophy 189 can count towards the 160-187 History requirement (not the 160-178 requirement).Though Heidegger’s opus magnum Being and Time (1927) has made major contributions to existential thought, hermeneutics, and post-structuralism its main concern is a revolution in what Heidegger regarded as the central term of philosophy since antiquity: the concept of being.  Because he viewed the traditional understanding of this concept as fatally superficial and misguided, his plan was to work out a new fundamental ontology. Its design was (1) to uncover the true meaning of being on the basis of temporality as its transcendental horizon and (2) to point out the crucial steps in the tradition (Aristotle, Descartes and Kant) that led to the misconception. Heidegger never finished this ambitious project, but the work’s first published part Being and Time (1927) still counts as one of the most challenging and important works of the 20th century. The course will focus on the connection between the question of being, the analysis of human nature, and the phenomenological method that Heidegger presents as the necessary foundation of his project in Division I of Being and Time. We will also cover the first three chapters of Division II including the analysis of death, conscience, resoluteness and Dasein’s authentic potentiality for being ‘whole’.Participants are required to give one short presentation (10-15 minutes, including a brief hand-out) and to write a final paper of 15 pages at the end of the semester.Text to be used: Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, translated by John Macquarrie/Edward Robinson, paperback reprint 2008, Harper Perennial Modern Thought Series. However, we will also extensively consult the revised 2010 edition by Dennis J. Schmidt of the Joan Stambaugh translation (Suny Series in Contemporary Philosophy). The course will be taught in a seminar format. Enrolment is limited to 19 and is by application only. Preference will be given to junior and senior philosophy majors. To apply to enrol students should write a brief email to the instructor (kuk@berkeley.edu) by May 24th describing their background in philosophy (courses taken) and their interest in the course. All applicants will be notified soon afterwards and those accepted will be given a course enrolment code via email.200

Graduate Seminar: Recent Work on Political Coercion.
Kolodny.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses.
It is generally thought to be wrong to use force against a person without
their consent.  I may not constrain, invade, or damage your body, for
example, not even with the aim of providing you or others with what would
otherwise be significant benefits.  Nor may I coerce you, by threatening
to use force.  But states do this as a matter of routine.  And they are
often thought to be permitted to do so.Why is this?  What is force?  What makes its use wrong, when it is wrong? 
It is just that force often has bad effects (e.g., it hurts)?  What is
wrong about threatening to use force, even when the force never
eventuates?  Why does consent affect whether force is permissible?  May
force ever be used without consent?  May force ever be used for ends other
than to respond to (e.g., defend against or punish) uses of force?  Is
there some difference between states and individuals that licenses states
to use force where individuals would be forbidden from using force?  Do
democracies, or states enjoying “the rule of law,” have better title to
use force?We will touch on a number of bordering topics in moral and political
philosophy: the nature and value of freedom, property and contracts,
liberalism and libertarianism, democratic theory, the justification of
self-defense and punishment, and the limits of the criminal law.We will begin with A. J. Simmons, John Rawls, and Joshua Cohen, and then
turn to more recent work by Philip Pettit, Arthur Ripstein, Japa
Pallikkathayil, and A.J. Julius.290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Social Choice Theory: Social Welfare&Individual Preferences.
Buchak.
W 4-6,
234 Moses.
This seminar explores connection between social welfare and individual
preferences.  What bearing does preference satisfaction have on
well-being?  Which normative principles are important to respect in social
distributions, and how are these principles represented in formal theories
about determining social welfare?  In particular, we will consider how
equality matters to the value of a social distribution; and whether a
social distribution should respect Pareto optimality, the idea that if
everyone prefers x to y then x is socially preferred to y.  We will also
consider the question of how interpersonal considerations in picking a
social distribution relate to individual considerations in picking a
gamble, and the question of what individual preferences in decision-making
under risk reveal about social preferences.  Finally, we will consider the
distribution of value over time.This course is intended for graduate students in philosophy, but advanced
undergraduates may enroll with permission.  No background in decision,
game, or social choice theory is required, but a general facility with
technical material is assumed.290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Uncovering Appearances: Perception, Object & Content.
Martin.
M 2-4,
234 Moses.
The seminar is principally concerned with framing and developing philosophical accounts of perception in response to the arguments from illusion and hallucination. The issues to be discussed fall into three broad topics:Object, Experience & Content: Framing the Problem(1)    Direct v Indirect Perception: What is the basis of this distinction in the traditional debate, how does this map on to concerns with sensory awareness and sense experience?(2)    Sensation & the Argument from Illusion: What picture of sense experience derives from a sense-datum account of sensory illusion? How does this inform a representational or intentional theory of perception?(3)   Intentionality & the Causal Argument: How does the Causal Argument, or the Argument from Hallucination, constrain the options for a theory of sense experience?Why be so Naïve? Reasons for a Relational Approach to Sensory Awareness(4)    Intentional v Relational pictures of sensory awareness I: the case of singular thought; applications to the particularity of sensory awareness & episodic memory(5)    Two-level approaches to phenomenal episodes: embedding sense experience – sensory imagination & episodic memory; explanatory challenge to intentional accounts.Disjunctivism: Formulation & Consequences(6)    Saving Appearances: disjunctivism as a response to the Causal Argument; the minimal form of disjunctivism so motivated; application of notions of indiscriminability to the case; consequences for non-transitivity of just noticeable difference; particularity of sensory awareness; impossible perception.(7)    Inner Awareness & Outer Knowledge: the unacceptability of disjunctivism concerning appearances, and differing views of our access to the inner realm.290-4 
Graduate Seminar: A Theory of Justice, Forty Years On.
Munoz-Dardé.
W 2-4,
234 Moses.
John Rawls radically altered the ways in which philosophers think about the question ‘How should we live together?’ when he published A Theory of Justice in 1971. Few philosophers would question that this work is the most ambitious and influential work on political philosophy produced during the twentieth century. The aim of this seminar is to engage with this work which has become a classic of philosophical and social thought.Course readings: A Theory of Justice (revised edition), by John Rawls (Harvard). Justice as Fairness: a Restatement, by John Rawls (Harvard). Lectures on the History of Political Philosophy, by John Rawls, Samuel Freeman ed., (Harvard). The Cambridge Companion to Rawls, Samuel Freeman, ed., (Cambridge).This course is intended for graduate students in philosophy, but advanced undergraduates may enroll with permission.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: Art and the Limits of Neuroscience.
Noë.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses.
This is a seminar on art and human nature. What is art? Why does it matter to us? What does it tell us about ourselves?We begin with a survey and critical examination of approaches to art that make use of methods and ideas from neuroscience. This approach, which is sometimes called “neuroaesthetics,” is increasingly popular not only in neuroscience, but also in fields of art (such as painting and choreography), as well in art history and criticism. We will also consider writings about art that draw heavily on Darwinian evolution (so-called “evolutionary psychology”). In the next part of the course, we will turn to new work that treats art as an “organizational practice.” This new approach holds out the promise of a more plausible account of art, its importance, and the origins of art in human biology. Art, according to this new approach, is a kind of philosophy (and philosophy is a kind of art).Our discussions will range over different fields, with special consideration of choreography, picture-making arts, writing, and the nature of technology.This is a graduate-level philosophy seminar, however students with different backgrounds will be welcome (but only with the instructor’s approval). Students will be required to write a term paper on a topic to be developed with the instructor.290-6 
Graduate Seminar:  Plato’s Sophist.
Clarke.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses.
In this seminar we will read (in translation) Plato’s dialogue the Sophist, a central work for his later metaphysics and philosophy of language. Major themes include: the definition of sophistry; the nature of being and non-being; the possibility of false statement and false belief. We will also look at a selection of recent work on the dialogue by authors such as Brown, Crivelli, Gill, and Leigh.290-7 
Graduate Seminar: Epistemic Logic & Epistemology.
Holliday.
F 12-2,
234 Moses.
Once conceived as a single formal system, epistemic logic has become a general
formal approach to the study of the structure of knowledge, its limits and
possibilities, and its static and dynamic properties.  Recently there has been a
resurgence of interest in the relation between epistemic logic and epistemology.
Some of the new applications of epistemic logic in epistemology go beyond the
traditional limits of the logic of knowledge, either by modeling the dynamic
process of knowledge acquisition or by modifying the representation of epistemic
states to reflect different theories of knowledge. In this seminar, we will
explore a number of topics at the intersection of epistemic logic and
epistemology, centered around epistemic closure, higher-order knowledge, and
paradoxes of knowability.295

This course aims to teach students with little or no philosophical
experience to write superb philosophical prose.  We’ll build skills
specific to philosophical writing while exploring historical and
cutting-edge philosophical problems.By analyzing others philosophers’ arguments, we’ll develop the skills
necessary to engage in a meaningful way with their views, and to formulate
in a clear way our own.  At the end of the course, students will produce a
research paper criticizing another answer to the question, and defending
an answer of their own.  This class fulfills the second semester R&C

Nature of Mind.
Noë.
MWF 4-5,
3 LeConte.
This is a course on the nature of mind. The central question we ask: Can we give an account of the mind within the framework of natural science? We will read widely in philosophy and cognitive science as we seek to answer this fundamental question. Among the topics we will cover: the nature of consciousness, the possibility of machine minds, neuroscience as the basic science of human experience, our knowledge of each other.4 
Knowledge & Its Limits.
Holliday.
MWF 10-11,
101 Barker.
In this course, we will investigate questions about the nature and limits of knowledge:  Is knowledge compatible with the possibility of human error? Is the structure of our knowledge like a building that rests on a foundation or like a web held together by its connections? What are the requirements for knowledge? Can one know by accident? How can we acquire knowledge and avoid misinformation from others? Who can we trust?11 
Introduction to Philosophy of Religion.
Buchak.
MWF 12-1,
2 LeConte.
This course addresses basic questions in the philosophy of religion, primarily from the Western philosophical tradition. For example, does God exist? Should we believe in God? Are there such things as souls, and if so, how do they interact with the physical body? How should a just God punish us for our moral wrongdoing? Finally, is morality based on God’s commands? The course material will be arranged topically, rather than historically, and will be divided into four sections: arguments for and against the existence of God, epistemology, metaphysics, and morality.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Warren.
MWF 1-2,
2060 Valley.
This course is intended to introduce the student to the
concepts and principles of deductive logic: symbolizing English language
sentences and arguments in terms of formalized languages; validity,
implication, and equivalence in truth-functional and quantificational
logic; systems of deduction, and their soundness and completeness. In
addition to the three lectures, each student will attend two sections per
week.Requirements: Lecture and section attendance, weekly problem sets, several in-section quizzes, a midterm and a final.Text: Warren Goldfarb’s /Deductive Logic/ , Hackett, 2003.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Ginsborg.
MWF 11-12,
145 Dwinelle.
The course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological
views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza,
Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the
existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the
body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the
nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics.
We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific
developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which
supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But
we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in
their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and
careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented
in them.100 
Philosophical Methods.
Stroud.
Tu 2-4,

A course to encourage in philosophy majors the practice and development of the skills of reading and writing in philosophy. Readings will be drawn from recent essays on a variety of subjects in different areas of philosophy. These will be discussed in one two-hour classroom meeting each week. Students will be expected to read and discuss the essays in class and to write clearly and accurately about them and about the questions they raise. Each student will meet individually with a graduate student instructor for close assessment and discussion of the student’s writing with special attention to how it could be improved. There will be a final paper on a topic of the student’s choice.Required reading: Joseph M. Williams, “Style: Toward Clarity and Grace” (U. Chicago Press).Course Reader104 
Ethical Theories.
Wallace.
MWF 11-12,
60 Evans.
This course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy.  We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as influential work by important contemporary philosophers (including Korsgaard, Nagel, Scanlon, and Williams).  Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)?  Why should we care about complying with moral demands?  What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)?  Is there anything interesting that we can say, in general terms, about what makes actions morally right or wrong?110 
Aesthetics.
Noë.
MWF 2-3,
30 Wheeler.
This course will explore topics in the philosophy of art.
What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a
picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is
performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human
nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these
and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a
range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century).Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled
Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited
by Cahn et al.This course is an upper division philosophy course. it is intended for
students with some background in philosophy. Students with knowledge of the
arts are welcome, space permitting, provided they are motivated to do
philosophy.112

Ginsborg.
Tu 1-4,

Philosophy 112.  Special Topics in Aesthetics: Music and MeaningInstructors:  Hannah Ginsborg (Philosophy), Mary Ann Smart (Music).This course will explore the question of whether music has meaning, and if so, what kind. Can music represent, say, birdsong, or the sea, or merely imitate? If music expresses emotions, then whose–those of the listener? the composer? the performer? We will consider parallels and contrasts between linguistic and musical meaning, theories of how music can be expressive, and the question of whether music can convey political meaning. The course will be taught as a seminar, and students will be expected to participate actively. Each week’s discussion will be structured around the interaction between musical excerpts and readings, drawn from historical and contemporary literature in philosophy, musicology, and the psychology of music. Requirements will include several short papers, a class presentation, and a final paper.   Please note that this course is being taught as part of the “Big Ideas” breadth program; for details of the program, see http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/.  It is also being taught under the title Music 128P: Music and Meaning.Enrollment in the course is limited and by instructor approval only.  If you are interested in enrolling, please send an email, with “Music and Meaning” in the subject line, to ginsborg@berkeley.edu and masmart@berkeley.edu.  One of the instructors will get back to you with details of the enrollment procedure.122 
Theory of Knowledge.
Gabriel.
MWF 10-11,
220 Wheeler.
The theory of knowledge or epistemology is concerned with questions such as: How is knowledge possible? What forms of knowledge are there? Can “knowledge” be defined? Can we know that we know anything whatsoever? In this course we will set out from a variety of skeptical problems, that is, problems resulting in paradoxes, which seem to prove that we cannot know anything. We will then discuss various responses to skeptical paradoxes. In the last part of the course, we will concentrate on some prominent analyses of “knowledge” and discuss whether an analysis of “knowledge” is feasible. In this context, we will also look at various contemporary responses to the problem of justification, which identifies justification as the problematic ingredient in our understanding of knowledge. Texts: There will be a reader with all the texts discussed in the lecture course. Recommended Introduction: Duncan Pritchard: What is This Thing Called Knowledge? Routledge, 2nd Edition 2009.125 
Metaphysics.
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,
100 Wheeler.
A lecture-and-discussion course on the nature and prospects of metaphysical understanding of the world.  Does metaphysics seek a conception of what is really so or how things really are independently of all the ways we think of or experience them?  What, if anything, can be discovered about such a world?  How are conclusions about it to be reached?  We will concentrate on questions about the independent metaphysical reality of (1) the colors of things (2) the relation of cause and effect (2) the necessity with which certain things must be so (4) the goodness or badness or other evaluative qualities of things.Familiarity with the history of modern philosophy (especially Hume and Kant) will be taken for granted.  Extensive reading and discussion of difficult abstract philosophical material is required, along with clear, careful writing of several focussed critical papers throughout the semester.An upper-division course not recommended for students still near the beginning of their study of philosophy.

Philosophy of Science.
Roush.
TuTh 11-12:30,
200 Wheeler.
This is a course about the epistemology of science. We will ask what makes something a scientific explanation, and what is required for observations to confirm (support) a hypothesis. We will ask how scientific models, experiments, and computer simulations are similar and different, and how scientists learn from each of these tools. We will pay particular attention to the example of climate models and simulations. Prerequisite: one course in philosophy.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
277 Cory.
The single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments?  What is the nature of perception?  This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.135 
Theory of Meaning.
MacFarlane.
TuTh 12:30-2,
200 Wheeler.
An examination of some philosophical problems about the intentionality
of language and thought. By virtue of what are some things in the world
(for example, sentences and thoughts) about others? Is meaning always a
matter of interpretation, or do some things have meaning independently
of interpretation? Is conceptual thought prior to language? What would
it take for a computer to have thoughts? Are the meanings of our words
and the contents of our mental states determined by what’s going on
inside our brains, or do they depend also on features of our physical
and social environments? Could there be facts about meaning we could
only discover by looking in someone’s brain? Are there objective facts
about meaning at all? In exploring these and related questions, we will
read the work of Quine, Davidson, Grice, Putnam, Dennett, Searle, Burge,
Block, Fodor, Dretske, and others.141 
Philosophy and Game Theory.
Buchak.
MWF 3-4,
100 Wheeler.
This course deals with applications of game theory and rational choice theory to philosophical problems, as well as with paradoxes and problems introduced by these theories. After introducing the basic concepts of game theory, the first part of the course will be devoted to problems of cooperation and convention: how people manage to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit, e.g. drive on the same side of the road, carry out a project together, or use language. The next section will explore non-cooperative games, such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma; the possible application of these games to moral problems; and the need for and execution of a social contract. Finally, we turn to problems dealing with groups, such as the problem of collective action, and some issues in group decision making.146 
Philosophy of Mathematics.
Mancosu.
MWF 11-12,

The course is an introduction to the classics of philosophy of
mathematics with emphasis on the debates on the foundations of
mathematics. Topics to be covered: infinitist theorems in seventeenth
century mathematics; the foundations of the Leibnizian differential
calculus and Berkeley’s ‘Analyst’; Kant on pure intuition in arithmetic
and geometry; the arithmetization of analysis (Bolzano, Dedekind);
Frege’s logicism; the emergence of Cantorian set theory; Zermelo’s

This course surveys the ideas and arguments of the first Greek philosophers, known as the “Presocratics”.  Topics to be covered: Presocratic theories of the nature of the physical world; paradoxes of motion, change and plurality; views about the sources and limits of human knowledge; the beginnings of moral and political philosophy in the sophists.181 
Hegel.
Gabriel.
MWF 2-3,
100 Wheeler.
In this course we will examine arguments from the most important texts by Hegel. In particularly, our focus will be on the epistemological and metaphysical topics in the Phenomenology of Spirit and in the Science of Logic. However, we will also discuss some aspects of Hegel’s practical philosophy, in particular the theory of action in the Philosophy of Right. Topics will include: the relationship of epistemology to skepticism, the contrast between self-consciousness and self-knowledge, Hegel’s concept of truth, and Hegel’s theory of action.  No prior knowledge of Hegel is required.Texts: There will be a reader with texts by Hegel and some recent secondary literature.

Schopenhauer’s pessimism and Nietzsche’s forceful ‘affirmation of life’ seem to be worlds apart from each other.  On closer analysis though, many of Nietzsche’s central theses can be understood properly only against the background of  Schopenhauer’s thought.The course offers a comparative study of both philosophers’ interpretations of life and human existence. Topics to be studied include their accounts of the role of art and the function of aesthetic experience; the nature of the drives (will); the relation between the intellectual ego and the bodily self; and the diagnoses and evaluation of nihilism. Readings from Schopenhauer’s philosophy will be drawn mostly from his famous The World as Will and Representation. The relevant works by Nietzsche span the different phases of his philosophy. We will concentrate on key selections from The Birth of the Tragedy, The Gay Science, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, The Genealogy of Morals and his posthumously published late notes (Will to Power). The course is intended for junior and senior philosophy majors. 
Enrollment by instructor’s approval only. Students who would like to enroll should write a brief email to the instructor (at kuk@berkeley.edu) detailing their background in philosophy and their interest in the course. 186b

Special Topics in the History of Philosophy: Leibniz on Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding.
Crockett.
MWF 12-1,
129 Barrows.
In his New Essays on Human Understanding, the rationalist philosopher Gottfried Leibniz offers a point by point critique of Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding.  Locke’s Essay contains extensive discussion of the “origin, certainty and extent of human knowledge,” which he uses to address problems in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of religion.  In this course we will examine Leibniz’s New Essays with the central goal of understanding the key points of difference between Leibniz’s rationalist epistemological and metaphysical views and Locke’s empiricist philosophical views.
While our central text will be Leibniz’s New Essays, we will supplement this with readings from Locke’s Essay, as well as other readings from Leibniz’s philosophical writings.187-2 
Friendship, Family, & Love in Chinese & Western Thinking.
Sluga.
TuTh 9:30-11,
3205 Dwinelle.
The course will focus on conceptions of friendship as well as related notions like family and love in Chinese and Western philosophy and literature. On the Chinese side we will read texts ascribed to Confucius and Zhuangzi, among others, as well as those by contemporary writers.  On the Western side we will concern ourselves with writings by Plato and Aristotle, as well as by a number of contemporary authors. Our interest is both in the question how friendship is understood and practiced and in the question of the special moral considerations to which it gives rise.188 
Phenomenology.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 11-12:30,
220 Wheeler.
As taught this semester, PHILOS 188 can count towards the 160-187 History requirement (not the 160-178 requirement.With growing interest in the role of the body in perception, and in the related question of the possibility and nature of non-conceptual content, Merleau-Ponty’s classic work, Phenomenology of Perception, has become increasingly relevant.  We will read Phenomenology of Perception in order to understand and evaluate Merleau-Ponty’s arguments against what he calls empiricism (a sort of behaviorism) and intellectualism (Cognitivism), as well as his positive account of what he calls motor intentionality  – a kind of intentionality without conceptual content that, Merleau-Ponty argues, is the basic way human beings are embedded in the world. 190 
Proseminar: Fact, Value, and Meaning.
MacFarlane.
TuTh 9:30-11,
234 Moses Hall.
Many philosophers have thought that there is an important difference
between factual and evaluative language.  When we say that Jim is
being cruel, or that he should not pull the cat’s tail, they hold, we
are not saying how things are, but expressing our disapproval and trying
to influence others. This view has major consequences for how we think
about moral and aesthetic argument and disagreements.  In this seminar,
we will consider the motivations for thinking that evaluative language
is nonfactual, and we will look at some difficulties that arise in
working out the idea.  Readings will be drawn mostly from twentieth
century analytic philosophers.This is a proseminar, which means that the format of the class will be
different from most classes in our department. I will not lecture.
Instead, we will try to come to grips with the texts by discussing them
collaboratively.  Participation and occasional presentations are
expected.  It is essential that you do the reading and think hard
about it before each class.This is an upper-level philosophy course.  Students should be philosophy
majors and must have taken at least two prior philosophy courses.290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Perceptual Attention, Perceptual Disorders and the First Person.
Campbell.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
We will be looking at recent work on perception, from both philosophy and psychology.  In particular, we’ll be looking at work on visual attention, and trying to gauge what impact this work should have on what we say about visual experience.  This has implications for a number of philosophical problems.  Conscious attention seems to be demanded by the role of vision in providing grasp of concepts of the objects and properties around us, and in generating propositional knowledge of our surroundings.  Conscious attention also seems to be required for intentional action on our surroundings.  If there’s time, we’ll also look at recent philosophical and empirical work on Molyneux’s Question.We’ll go on to look at some perceptual disorders, in particular, perceptual disorders in schizophrenia.  We’ll review the phenomenon of intentional binding (a certain compression in your experience of time between your action and its outcome), and how this seems to be different in schizophrenic patients.  We’ll also look at some of the perceptual hallucinations and delusions characteristic of schizophrenia.Finally, we’ll consider the role of perception in an understanding of the first person:  an understanding of how to use ‘I’ and related terms.  Classically, Descartes held that your understanding of ‘I’ does not at all depend on your ability to perceive your surroundings.  We’ll discuss whether the Cogito does establish this, and at different pictures of the role perception might play in establishing one’s own existence.290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Aristotle’s Conception of Animal and Human Agency.
Corcilius.
W 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
Aristotle’s science of living beings contains a joint or “common” account of animal and human locomotion. At the center of this common account lies a certain conception of animal and human agency, which also forms the basis for Aristotle’s accounts of moral responsibility, of morally good action and akratic behavior. The seminar aims at a philosophical evaluation of this conception. Sections from the following books will be read and discussed: Physics VIII; De Anima III; De Motu Animalium; Nicomachean Ethics III, VI, VII.Requirements: Phil. 161 or equivalent. Knowledge of Greek is welcome, but not required.290-4 
Graduate Seminar: Social Psychology & Philosophy.
Madva.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
Research in social psychology has exploded over the past 30 or so
years, generating powerful new methods of measurement and a broad
range of surprising and sometimes downright puzzling findings.  But
while philosophers have taken a keen interest in other areas within
the “mind/brain sciences” (such as, e.g., perception, consciousness,
language, reasoning, moral psychology, and action), social psychology
has been largely neglected.  This course will examine how recent
findings in social psychology speak to perennial questions in mind,
ethics, and political philosophy, including the nature of freedom,
moral responsibility, self-knowledge, belief, desire, emotion, and
prejudice.  We will also take a critical look at the methods,
presuppositions, and theories of contemporary social psychology “on
its own terms,” i.e., considered apart from its relevance to
traditional philosophical issues.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: The Intentionality of Perceptual Experience.
Searle.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
I think many, indeed most, of the philosophical confusions about perception come from a failure to understand the intentionality of perceptual experience. Many philosophers deny that perception has intentionality, and even those who accept it tend to give a false account of the intentionality. A correct account will not only enable us to give an adequate account of perceptual experiences but to refute the standard mistakes in the field, such as phenomenalism, the representative theory, disjunctivism, etc.This subject obviously opens up into a whole lot of related subjects in epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind, and I intend to pursue several of those.290-6 
Graduate Seminar: Recent Work on Reasons and Normativity.
Wallace.
M 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
We will look at some recent work in metaethics, focusing on questions about reasons for action and (practical) normativity, which have attracted a very lively contemporary discussion. Issues to be discussed include the objectivity of reasons; the connections between reasons and rational agency; the naturalistic challenge to normativity; the prospects for understanding discourse about reasons without postulating normative facts or truths; and the relations between reasons for action and the agent’s desires.Works to be discussed include recent contributions by Blackburn, Parfit, Raz, Scanlon, Street, Thomson, and others.290-7 
Graduate Seminar: Kant’s Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science.
Warren.
F 3-5,
234 Moses Hall.
The Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, which Kant wrote in 1786, applies the metaphysical and epistemological doctrines of the Critique of Pure Reason in support of a broadly Newtonian physics.  We will focus on such topics as the purpose of the Metaphysical Foundations and its account of the need for a grounding for natural science, the relation between the Metaphysical Foundations and the Critique, the role of mathematics in natural science, the contrast between relative and absolute motion, the status of absolute space, the notions of substance and causation, the account of force and the contrast between the mechanical and dynamical theory of matter, and the notions of inertia and of the communication of motion.  Alongside the primary texts by Kant, we will be spending much of the semester reading Michael Friedman’s forthcoming book, Kant’s Construction of Nature.

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Berkey.
MTuWTh 12-2,
166 Barrows.
This course is an introduction to moral and political philosophy. We will
consider a range of ethical issues regarding individual conduct as well as
social arrangements, policies, and practices. We will begin by considering
whether there are objective ethical truths, examining several arguments
for the view that ethics is not objective as well as responses to those
arguments. Next we will consider what, if anything, well-off individuals
are obligated to do to aid the very poor. We will then examine the ethics
of meat consumption, abortion, and euthanasia. Next we will look at two
influential views of distributive justice, and consider whether equality
is a moral ideal that we should endorse and seek to achieve. We will then
examine the ethics of affirmative action, and the issues of free speech,
tolerance, and multiculturalism. We will conclude by considering some
ethical issues regarding war and terrorism.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Andrews.
MTuWTh 10-12,
170 Barrows.
We digest, we scrape our knees, our toenails grow. From this perspective we seem to be physical creatures in a physical world. But we also see the red of the tomato, we feel the pangs of longing, our humor is stoked by the nice delivery of a joke. We have a conscious mental life the variety and quality of which is difficult to put into words. From this perspective
it may seem very difficult to see ourselves are merely physical organisms. So the problem is this: can both of these perspectives be accounted for within a coherent and broadly natural theory of the mind?Towards an answer to this question we will study the mind from a
philosophical point of view. Our primary question will be: what is the relation between the mind and the physical world? Is the mind part of the physical world? Is our mental life just another physical processes like digestion? Or is it rather that the mind is non-physical in nature and hence that it cannot be accounted for in physical terms?The study of these questions will involve us with dualism, physicalism, the identity theory, behaviorism, functionalism, the problem of consciousness, personal identity, the neural correlates of consciousness and other related issues. We will read Putnam, Descartes, Hume, Chalmers, Smart, Turing, Nagel, Jackson and others.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Bledin.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
156 Dwinelle.
This course is a gentle introduction to symbolic logic. Most generally,
we’ll be investigating the concept of logical consequence, roughly, the
notion that certain claims follow from certain other ones in virtue of
their logical form. To try to sharpen our understanding of this concept
and
various related ones, we’ll learn a new formal language—the language of
first-order logic—in stages. At each stage, we’ll make sense of logical
concepts in terms of the truth values of sentences in the new language. In
addition, we’ll learn a useful method for demonstrating that sentences in
the language are logical consequences of others: natural deduction proofs
in a Fitch-style system.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
McLeod.
MTuWTh 12-2,
170 Barrows.
This course will provide an introduction to the history of philosophy and
to philosophical thinking in general. Students new to the subject will
acquire a crucial foundation for further study in philosophy or related
subjects, while students with more experience will develop a sense of
different approaches to familiar problems. We will examine the beginnings
of philosophy in ancient Greece and trace some of its developments over
the course of antiquity. At the same time, we will try to understand what
ancient Greeks took to be philosophical problems in areas ranging from the
nature of what exists and the knowledge of it to questions of how each
person should live and how people should live together. We will also
explore how those problems resonate with concerns of modern philosophers.
The course will begin with early Greek philosophy, then focus primarily on
Plato and Aristotle, and conclude with a brief treatment of the
philosophical schools that grew up after Aristotle.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Crockett.
MTuWTh 10-12,
102 Wurster.
In this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries).  This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years.  Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined.  The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled.By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries.  Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally.  Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy.  It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind?  What are the limits of human knowledge?  What is a person?  What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy.  In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy.  For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Skokowski.
MThF 10-12:30,
9 Evans.
What is the mind? Is the mind just the brain, or is it something different altogether? Can we know anything about other minds? How does the mind represent the world? What is the nature of conscious experience? In this course we will examine historical as well as contemporary approaches to these problems. Our goal will be to determine whether mind can be accounted for in a physical universe.153 
Chinese Philosophy.
Tiwald.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
534 Davis.
This course will introduce students to the major schools of philosophy in
classical China, including Confucianism, Mohism and Daoism. Although the
course is meant primarily as a survey of the most important Chinese
thinkers, a prominent theme will be their views on moral cultivation and
moral agency. Philosophers of this era were greatly interested in the
development of good character and the key features of proper moral
knowledge and motivation. All Chinese texts will be in translation.161 
Aristotle.
Corcilius.

The Nature of Mind.
Sethi.
MTuWTh 10-12,
3109 Etcheverry.
This class is an introduction to the fundamental issues in the study of mind. What is a mind? What are mental states such as beliefs and desires and perceptions? Should we explain what they are in terms of behavior, their connections to other mental states or the way it feels to be in that mental state?  How is the mind related to the body? What is consciousness? Is there room for consciousness within a scientific worldview? What must our mental states be like if they are to allow for genuine knowledge of the external world? In this class, we will learn about Dualism, Behaviorism, Identity Theory, Functionalism, and also look at powerful challenges that have been posed to each of these views.
This is an introductory class in philosophy and so we will also learn the basic tools of philosophical thinking and writing. No prerequisites.7 
Existentialism in Literature & Film.
Chislenko.
MTuWTh 2-4,
215 Dwinelle.
In the modern era, a tradition of philosophers and artists began to
question the meaning-giving status of social custom, and eventually of
rationality and religion. The breakdown of rational and religious
authority raises the threat of nihilism, the total absence of meaning or
value. It also calls for a new kind of thinking, a new vocabulary and an
alternative to rational argumentation to find meaning independently of God
or reason. This course follows the development of existentialism from its
religious beginnings in Pascal and Kierkegaard, through Dostoyevsky’s
masterpiece The Brothers Karamazov and Nietzsche’s atheistic affirmation
of life, and into the 20th century.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Klempner.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
3111 Etcheverry.
Logic is about reasoning.  People reason well or reason poorly; people’s arguments are good or bad.  Logic is concerned with telling the difference; specifically, we will look at formal systems for characterizing and evaluating the structure of arguments.  A good, or valid, deductive argument is one in which the conclusion follows from the premises—one in which true premises would guarantee a true conclusion.  Our study of formal systems will yield methods for figuring out when arguments are valid.This class is in many ways like a math class: the work will primarily involve doing logic problems.  It should, however, give you a greater appreciation for the structure of arguments in ordinary English.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Berkey.
MTuWTh 10-12,

This course is an introduction to ancient philosophy, and to philosophical

their arguments for those views, and the ways in which their work has
helped to shape contemporary philosophical debates.25B

Political Philosophy.
Grosser.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
3111 Etcheverry.
This introductory class will examine the works of four classical protagonists of Western political thought – Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, and John Rawls. It is meant to provide students with a basic understanding of paradigmatic ancient, early-modern, and contemporary political theories: An understanding of the underlying metaphysical, ontological, and anthropological assumptions that essentially inform these theories; of the relevance and specific meaning of concepts such as justice, freedom, or power; and, most importantly, of differing argumentative strategies of justifying the existence of the state philosophically. Thus, based on a careful reading of their politico-philosophical writings, it is to be considered how Plato and Aristotle, Hobbes and Rawls aim at finding a balance that resolves the inescapable tension between (stately) authority and (individual) autonomy. Additionally, the course aims at identifying the concepts of the political that, implicitly or explicitly, organize the political theories discussed.133 
Philosophy of Language.
Strelau.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
136 Barrows.
This course will focus largely on three interconnected areas:  what is it for a person to know the meaning of a language?  How is language related to the world?  How is language used in communication, and how does this use impact meaning?
    We’ll begin with the ‘classical’ accounts of Frege and Bertrand Russell, which influence much of the discussion that follows.  We’ll then consider Searle’s broadly Fregean account; it explains linguistic meaning in terms of the mental states (intentions, beliefs, desires) that underlie speech acts.  As do many Fregeans, Searle holds that “what’s in the head” is sufficient to determine a unique referent for proper names and general terms.  This view is vigorously attacked by Putnam, Kripke, and Burge, who argue that unique reference requires an external causal chain.  Searle’s reply turns on his analysis of demonstratives and indexicals (‘this’, ‘you’); we’ll compare this with standard accounts of demonstratives by Kaplan and Strawson.
    Quine approaches meaning from the point of view of ‘radical translation’ of a completely unknown language.  He argues that alternative translations are always possible (“indeterminacy of translation”), and therefore there is no matter of fact about meaning.  Davidson makes similar use of a 3rd person ‘interpreter’, but concludes that meaning is what is common to all possible interpretations.  Davidson’s theory of meaning makes central use of Tarski’s theory of truth, so we will read Tarski.  Davidson uses Tarski’s theory as a framework for a truth-conditional semantics for natural language.  We’ll also discuss the possible worlds approach to semantics (Lewis’ version).  McDowell charges that Davidson’s combination of holism and causal theory leaves us “spinning in the void” and unconnected to the world; we’ll take steps towards evaluating both McDowell’s argument and his positive account.
    Other topics will include:  Wittgenstein and Kripke on following a rule; refinements of the causal theory of reference by Dretske and Fodor; Grice’s theory of meaning; non-literal uses of language (implicature, metaphor, fiction, literary theory).  Many of our readings discuss holism and normativity.  Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California3 
The Nature of Mind.
Campbell.
TuTh 2-3:30,
141 McCone.
In this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.6 
Man, God & Society in Western Literature.
Madva.
MWF 12-1,

This course will explore fundamental questions about the human
condition—including the nature of freedom, the good life, justice, and
the individual’s relation to family, friends, romantic partners, the
wider community, and God(s)—through the lens of classic literary and
religious texts, including Homer, the Bible, Dante, Shakespeare,
Dostoevsky, and more recent fiction.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Yalcin.
MWF 1-2,
2060 Valley.
An introduction to the concepts and principles of deductive logic. Students will learn how to formalize basic patterns of argument and how to evaluate them for correctness systematically. The course covers the the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Time permitting, we will touch upon some metalogical results. Throughout we emphasize philosophical applications of logical tools and distinctions.24 
Freshman Seminar: Computer Simulation in Science&Philosophy.
Roush.
W 4-5,
201 Wheeler.
We ask three questions: How does computer simulation work as a method in science? Does artificial intelligence programming simulate minds or make them? Is the universe a giant computer simulation, and if so how would we know?   This seminar is part of the On the Same Page initiative. 24-2 
Freshman Seminar: Reading the Brothers Karamazov As an Answer to Electronic Isolation.
Dreyfus.
F 3-4,
201 Wheeler.
A decade ago, Bowling Alone noted our increasing disconnection from social groups.  Recently Sherry Turkle’s Alone Together argues that, thanks to instant messaging, the web, social media and texting, we are now hyper-connected, and yet we are even more isolated.  But neither book shows us what it would be like to be genuinely in touch with one another.  Prophetically, The Brothers Karamazov offers an account of the origin and spread of a kind of total caring that draws human beings joyfully together.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Clarke.
MWF 11-12,
145 Dwinelle.
This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. Most of the course will be devoted to the thought of Socrates (469-399 BCE), Plato (427-347), and Aristotle (384-322). We will also look briefly at the Presocratics and the Sophists, and at the major philosophical movements of the Hellenistic period: the Epicureans, Stoics, and Sceptics.Prerequisites: None.Required texts:
(1) Plato: Five Dialogues, 2nd edn., tr. Grube
(2) Plato: The Republic, ed. Ferrari, tr. Griffith
(3) Aristotle: Introductory Readings, tr. Irwin and Fine
(Note: Students intending to take Philosophy 160 in a future semester may want to purchase Plato: Complete Works (ed. Cooper) instead of the two Plato volumes above.)100 
Philosophical Methods.
Warren.
W 2-4,
88 Dwinelle.
THIS COURSE IS RESTRICTED TO PHILOSOPHY MAJORS. It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy. Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills. This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the problem of personal identity. There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading. In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper.Text: Personal Identity, edited by John Perry, University of California Press104 
Ethical Theories.
Wallace.
MWF 11-12,
219 Dwinelle.
This course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy.  We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as influential work by important contemporary philosophers (including Korsgaard, Nagel, Scanlon, and Williams).  Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)?  Why should we care about complying with moral demands?  What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)?  Is there anything interesting that we can say, in general terms, about what makes actions morally right or wrong?112 
Special Topics in Aesthetics: Music & Meaning.
Ginsborg.
M 1-4,
124 Morrison.
This course will explore the question of whether music has meaning, and if so, what kind. Can music represent, say, birdsong, or the sea, or merely imitate? If music expresses emotions, then whose–those of the listener? the composer? the performer? We will consider parallels and contrasts between linguistic and musical meaning, theories of how music can be expressive, and the question of whether music can convey political meaning. The course will be taught as a seminar, and students will be expected to participate actively. Each week’s discussion will be structured around the interaction between musical excerpts and readings, drawn from historical and contemporary literature in philosophy, musicology, and the psychology of music. Requirements will include several short papers, a class presentation, and a final paper.

Political Philosophy.
Munoz-Dardé.
TuTh 11-12:30,
30 Wheeler.
This course is devoted to some of the central questions in contemporary political philosophy: liberty, justice and equality. The course is focused particularly on the work of John Rawls.122 
Theory of Knowledge.
Roush.
MWF 11-12,
200 Wheeler.
By any reasonable account, human beings have more knowledge today than ever before due to the progress of science, but there is still philosophical disagreement about what knowledge and justified belief are, how we should respond to radical skepticism, and how much science itself can tell us about knowledge. In this problem-oriented course we will study contemporary classics of epistemology on the topics of skepticism, justification, foundationalism, epistemic intuitions, tracking, closure, reliabilism, internalism, and externalism, among others.  We will take epistemology to be responsible for understanding scientific cases of knowledge, and also consider the implications for epistemology of results in experimental psychology suggesting human beings’ lack of awareness of the true reasons for their beliefs.128 
Philosophy of Science.
Roush.
MWF 3-4,
109 Morgan.
This is a course about the epistemology of science. We will ask what makes something a scientific explanation, and what is required for observations to confirm (support) a hypothesis. We will ask how scientific models, experiments, and computer simulations are similar and different, and how scientists learn from each of these tools. We will pay particular attention to the example of climate models and simulations. Prerequisite: one course in philosophy.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
50 Birge.
The single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments?  What is the nature of perception?  This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.136

Medieval Philosophy.
Crockett.
MWF 1-2,
110 Wheeler.
As taught this semester, this course satisfies the 160-187 (but not the 160-178) requirement for the major.This course will be a study of some of the major philosophical texts from the Medieval Period with a focus on issues in metaphysics and epistemology.  Special attention will be paid to the ways in which the philosophers in this period assimilate Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy into religious thought and how they anticipate certain aspects of modern philosophy.  Topics will include the nature of universals, individuation, the nature and existence of God, faith and reason, skepticism, freedom, human nature and human cognition.160 
Plato.
Corcilius.
MWF 12-1,
110 Wheeler.
This course is an introduction into the main currents within Plato’s philosophy. This will include his conceptions of philosophy, the good life, the soul, causes and explanation, the hypothesis of the Forms, his account of human knowledge and some of the developments and revisions of these conceptions. Towards the second half of the semester the discussion will focus largely on Plato’s moral psychology. Important secondary literature will be made available on bspace. No previous knowledge of Plato required. Students are expected to actively participate and to occasionally give presentations. Required text: Plato. Complete Works. Ed. J. M. Cooper Indianapolis 1997. Hackett Publishing Company. ISBN 0–87220–349–2. 170 
Descartes.
Crockett.
TuTh 11-12:30,
200 Wheeler.
This course will provide an intensive introduction to Descartes’s views on
physics, metaphysics and epistemology.  We will begin by examining some of
Descartes’s early works on method, physics and physiology.  We will then
turn to an in-depth study of the Meditations, focusing on both Descartes’s
epistemological project and his anti-scholastic metaphysics.  We will
supplement our study of the Meditations with readings from the Objections
and Replies, the Principles, and several important pieces of secondary
literature.  Some of the issues we will discuss in this section include
the method of doubt, the Cartesian circle, Descartes’s mode of
presentation in the Meditations, the creation and ontological status of
the eternal truths, the status of the human being, the nature of
substance, and the real distinction between mind and body.  After our
study of the Meditations, we will examine Descartes’s physics as presented
in the Principles.176

Topics in Recent European Philosophy: Later Heidegger.
Kaiser.
W 2-5,
30 Wheeler.
As taught this semester, this course satisfies the 160-187 (but not the 160-178) requirement for the major.The course will focus on the relations between language, art, poetry and technology in Heidegger’s later philosophy. His diagnosis of our “forgetfulness of being” will be explored in the context of his interpretations of Hölderlin and Nietzsche, both of whom grappled with the nihilism latent in modernity (“destitute times”/”The desert grows”). Particular attention will be paid to Heidegger’s focus on the role of works of art and poetry, “Things”, and “reflective thinking” as opening up possible ways out of this condition.Readings will include such central texts as “The Origin of the Work of Art”, “What are Poets for?” “The Question Concerning Technology”, “The Thing” and “On the Way to Language”.
Required texts: the essay collections Martin Heidegger. Poetry, Language, Thought (transl. Hofstadter). Martin Heidegger. The Question Concerning Technology and other Essays (transl. William Lovitt). Additional texts will be made available on bSpace.The course will be taught as a small seminar aimed at advanced students of philosophy, preferably with some background in Heidegger and/or Nietzsche.
Enrollment is limited, and by application only. Students should apply to the instructor directly (at kuk@berkeley.edu) at their earliest convenience; an initial selection will be made at the beginning of June.  Applications should include a brief statement outlining the applicant’s philosophical background and interest in the seminar. All applicants will be notified via email as to the result of their application; those admitted will receive course enrollment numbers with which they can enroll in the seminar through TeleBears.200 
First-Year Graduate Seminar.
Campbell/Stroud.

290-1 
Graduate Seminar: Decision Theory: Paradoxes and Alternatives.
Buchak.
W 2-4,
234 Moses.
This seminar will explore classical decision theory and the alternatives that have arisen in recent years, in response to problems surrounding (1) risk-aversion; (2) non-sharp probabilities; (3) infinite utilities; and (4) acts that are evidence for outcomes but not causally efficacious.  We will work through selections from my forthcoming book as well as a number of articles, both classic and recent.290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Aristotle’s Physics I.
Clarke.
W 4-6,
234 Moses.
We will read Aristotle’s Physics Book I, his inquiry into the principles of nature. Topics include: Aristotle’s philosophical methodology; his engagement with Eleatic arguments against plurality and coming to be; his analysis of change; the concepts of matter and form; hylomorphism. (We will read the text in translation. There will also be a weekly Greek reading group for those interested.)290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Modality, Partiality, and Perspective.
Holliday.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses.
This seminar will address a number of foundational issues concerning “possible worlds-based” approaches to language and thought: total worlds vs. partial situations; partial modal logic; aboutness; indexicals and indices; centered worlds; de se attitudes; and more.290-4 
Graduate Seminar: Time, Experience, and Mental Representation.
Lee.
M 2-4,
234 Moses.
The main topic for this seminar is the experience of time, and also the mental representation of time more generally. We’ll talk about subjective duration, including empirical models of psychological timing; extensionalism and retensionalism about temporal experience; the flow of time, and the continuity and unity over time of experience. The seminar will begin with an opinionated overview of some more general issues about experience and mental representation which will be relevant, including: quality spaces and phenomenal properties, internalist vs externalist views of experience, different views of computational explanation and mental representation.Note for those of you who attended my Unity and Temporal Experience seminar : I’ll try to minimize the overlap in content with this seminar, although inevitably there will be at least some.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: Assessment Sensitivity.
MacFarlane.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses.
The seminar will focus on the issues discussed in my forthcoming book,
Assessment Sensitivity: Relative Truth and Its Applications
(PDF).  The book
attempts to make solid philosophical sense of the fraught idea that
truth might be “relative,” an idea with a long philosophical history and
few adherents in the analytic tradition. It describes a novel way in
which thoughts and linguistic expressions can be contextually sensitive.
Familiar context-sensitive words like “here” and “I” are semantically
sensitive to features of the context of use. Thus, “here” denotes the
location at which the word is being used, “I” denotes the person using
it. Similarly, the truth of a tensed sentence like “Obama is president”
depends on the time of use.  Call this familiar kind of context
sensitivity use sensitivity. Assessment sensitivity, by contrast, is
semantic sensitivity to features of the context in which a use of the
expression is being assessed (in my lingo, a context of assessment).
Because a particular use of an expression can be assessed from
indefinitely many different contexts, it does not make sense to talk of
“the context of assessment” associated with a particular such use.
Rather, truth must be relativized to contexts of assessment. Thus,
making sense of semantic assessment sensitivity requires making sense of
(a certain kind of) “relative truth” – a notion often held to be
incoherent.Part of the work, then, is devoted to explaining how we can make room
for assessment sensitivity within existing formal semantic frameworks,
and to making an empirical case for the assessment sensitivity of
several kinds of discourse that have been puzzled philosophers and
linguists, including future contingents, predicates of personal taste,
knowledge ascriptions, epistemic modals, deontic claims, and indicative
conditionals. And part of the work is devoted to the more philosophical
task of fending off principled worries about the kind of “relative
truth” that the proposals countenance, and giving us a solid grip on
what it means to say that an expression is assessment-sensitive.The aim is to read and discuss the whole book, which will be the main
text for the seminar.  Supplementary readings will be suggested for each
chapter.290-6 
Graduate Seminar: Problems with Authority: Themes from The Morality of Freedom.
Munoz-Dardé.
Tu 2-4,
107 Mulford.
We’ll be looking back a quarter of a century at Joseph Raz’s The Morality of Freedom, and some of the central themes that classic text raises for us.The issues we are to address can be organized under three headings:(a) Authority & Consent(b) Neutrality & Paternalism© Consequentialism & Separatness of Person(a) Authority & Consent
One of the distinctive elements of Raz’s The Morality of Freedom is functional theory of authority it offers at the outset. It will be useful to contrast this with Anscombe’s earlier discussion of authority. We’ll finish off this topic looking back to earlier attempts to connect questions of authority and obligation to the existence of institutions.(b) Neutrality & Paternalism
Is it a requirement on a just politic order (or a just such order as conceived by liberalism) to be neutral among conceptions of the good? Raz launches a vituperative attack on what he sees as Rawls’s moral relativism lurking behind the demand for neutrality. We can compare this disagreement to some recent discussions of these issues: first Jonathan Quong’s complaint of paternalism against Raz; secondly van Wietmarschen and Leland’s attempt to understand it purely in terms of epistemic modesty.© Consequentialism & Separateness of Person
Despite the manner in which Raz insists his liberalism is different from Rawls, both join forces against traditional utilitarianism, and its modern consequentialist developments. We’ll look at Raz’s discussion of consequentialism and compare that to Williams’s original discussions of integrity. Again we’ll set this earlier discussion in the context of some more recent debate, in this case Larry Temkin’s discussion of separateness of person in his recent book.290-7 
Graduate Seminar: Consciousness by John R. Searle.
Searle.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses.
Consciousness is becoming more and more a central topic in analytic philosophy, and I want to pursue both some traditional and more recent issues.  Specifically the recent analysis in terms of information theory, by Tononi and Koch, I think is mistaken, and I want to say exactly how.  Nagel’s recent book Mind and Cosmos expresses doubts that we can explain consciousness with our existing conceptual resources.  I think he is mistaken and I want to say again how exactly how.  A third issue that I want to resume is the discussion of the Connection Principle relating consciousness to unconsciousness.  I think that these issues are at the very heart of cognitive science explanations.  A whole series of issues is raised by recent emphasis on the unconscious as more important than consciousness.  Such authors as Libet, Jeannerod, and Wegner should all be considered.  We cannot cover all of the issues in one semester, but I would like a general theory of consciousness to emerge. Anyone wishing to see a simple presentation of my general approach should see my recent TED talk at CERN in Geneva.295

The course seeks to provide a comprehensive picture of ethics by comparing a variety of views from Western and Non-Western sources. There will be a number of tests during the semester as well as a written final exam. All textual material will be contained in a class reader. 3 
The Nature of Mind.
Lee.
TuTh 2-3:30,
145 Moffitt.
This course will be an introduction to some of the major debates in Philosophy of Mind. Is consciousness a purely physical phenomenon? Is the brain a computer and the mind its software? Are our common-sense ideas about how to explain people’s behavior compatible with contemporary scientific views about the structure of the brain? How can the mind represent the external world?4 
Knowledge & Its Limits.
Holliday.
MWF 10-11,
2 LeConte.
In this course, we will investigate questions about the nature and limits of knowledge: Is knowledge compatible with the possibility of human error? Is the structure of our knowledge like a building that rests on a foundation or like a web held together by its connections? What are the requirements for knowledge? Can one know by accident? How can we acquire knowledge and avoid misinformation from others? Whom can we trust?11 
Introduction to Philosophy of Religion.
Crockett.
TuTh 11-12:30,
145 Moffitt.
The aim of this course is to apply the concepts and methodology of contemporary philosophy to basic questions in the philosophy of religion, with an emphasis on the Western philosophical and religious traditions.  This includes questions concerning the nature and existence of God, the contrast between faith and reason, the nature of religious experience, the possibility of life after death, the incomprehensibility of God, and the relationship between God and morality.  The course readings will primarily be contemporary, though there will be some historical readings, and the course material will be arranged topically rather than chronologically.  This is a lower division course and so no prior experience in philosophy is required. 12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Warren.
MWF 12-1,
2060 Valley.
This course is intended to introduce the student to the concepts and principles of deductive logic: symbolizing English language sentences and arguments in terms of formalized languages; validity, implication, and equivalence in truth-functional and quantificational logic; systems of deduction, and their soundness and completeness. In addition to the three lectures, each student will attend two sections per week.Requirements: Lecture and section attendance, weekly problem sets, several in-section quizzes, a midterm and a final.Text: Warren Goldfarb’s /Deductive Logic/ , Hackett, 2003.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Ginsborg.
MWF 11-12,
4 LeConte.
The course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics. We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.84 
Sophomore Seminar: Street Art.
Yalcin.
Tu 5-6,
203 Wheeler.
The idea of this seminar is to broach two questions: (1) What is street art? (2) When, where, and how can it be morally permissible? The first question is broadly speaking metaphysical: it is about the nature of certain sorts of things in our social world. This part of the seminar will to some extent engage the classic, much larger question of what art is, but via the special case of street art. The second question is an ethical question. Street art characteristically appears without permission on private property, or in public spaces that are centrally controlled. It often involves violations of law. When exactly is it wrong? A special case we will discuss is this: some street artists are especially known for removing advertising and replacing it with their artwork. Is this kind of thing wrong, or always wrong? Or can it be a legitimate form of protest? With whom exactly does legitimate control of the public visual space lie? Students of philosophy, art, art history, urban planning, and areas allied to these would be natural candidates for this course. But I will not be presupposing any specific background knowledge. So the course should make sense for any interested student prepared to think critically about these issues. 98-1

Philosophical Methods.
Yalcin.
Th 12-2,
166 Barrows.
A course to encourage in philosophy majors the practice and development of the skills of reading and writing in philosophy. Readings will be drawn from recent essays on a variety of subjects in different areas of philosophy. These will be discussed in one two-hour classroom meeting each week. Students will be expected to read and discuss the essays in class and to write clearly and accurately about them and about the questions they raise. Each student will meet individually each week with a graduate student instructor for close assessment and discussion of the student’s writing with special attention to how it could be improved.108 
Contemporary Ethical Issues.
Kolodny.
TuTh 9:30-11,
289 Cory.
Note: As taught this semester, Philosophy 108 will satisfy the Ethics requirement.As a thoughtful person, living in this country, at this time, you have at some point asked yourself some of the following questions. Should torture be allowed? Is there any difference between terrorism and “collateral damage”? May we kill enemy soldiers or even civilians to protect ourselves? Is capital punishment moral? Is abortion? Whether or not it’s moral, should it be legal? Should we let the majority or the courts decide? Is the government allowed to take your money and use it in ways you don’t want? If you have better grades and higher test scores, do you deserve a spot at UC more? Are you allowed to buy yourself an iPod when you could use the money to save people from starving? Should you buy a hybrid, rather than an SUV, when your individual choice is just “a drop in the bucket” and won’t really affect global warming?These questions can be difficult for many different reasons. Self- interest, prejudice, and fear can cloud our judgment. Religious authorities that we accept on faith, such as the Bible, can give unclear or conflicting directions. Finally, it can be hard to be sure of relevant facts: for example, whether information gained through torture tends to be reliable, whether the justice system applies the death penalty consistently, or whether burning fossil fuels leads to climate change.This course, however, is about another set of difficulties, which persist when we set aside our personal feelings, we see how far we can get without relying on faith, and we assume that we know the relevant facts. We may not be able to decide, by our own reflection and reasoning, which answers are correct, and even when we are sure that certain answers are correct, we may not be able to justify them. Our ethical ideas may seem not up to the task. Our aim in this course is to come to terms with these difficulties and to see to what extent they can be overcome.125 
Metaphysics.
Lee.
TuTh 11-12:30,
200 Wheeler.
This course will be a survey of some ongoing debates in metaphysics. Questions we will consider will include: Why does the universe exist? Is time’s passage an illusion? Is space a container and the world its contents? What is it for an object to exist at more than one time? Do other possible worlds exist?129 
Special Topics in the Philosophy of Science: The Philosophy of Space and Time.
Ryckman.
TuTh 11-12:30,
78 Barrows.
I. TOPICS: Absolute and relational theories of space, time, and motion: the problem of motion from Descartes, Newton and Leibniz to Einstein and beyond.  How the principle of relativity leads from space and time to space-time.  Mach’s attempt to ‘relativize’ inertia and its influence on Einstein in formulating the general theory of relativity.  Space-time substantivalism and relationism.  The problem of determinism in Einstein’s “Hole Argument”, and the physical meaning of general covariance. Background independence as a requirement for fundamental physical theory, including quantum gravity.II. PREREQUISITES: Some background in philosophy, physics or mathematics will be helpful. While no detailed knowledge of relativity physics or higher mathematics is presumed, discussion of the philosophical issues will occasionally necessitate introducing small doses of reasonably advanced mathematics (the mathematics of the general theory of relativity). However, most of the central concepts can be explained in pictures (as mappings) with a bit of set theory. Leave math anxiety at the door.III. REQUIRED READINGS.– In addition to the following books (first three in paper editions), there will be a course reader, containing readings from Descartes, Berkeley, Euler, Mach, Poincaré, and Einstein.• Newton: Philosophical Writings.  Edited by Andrew Janiak. Cambridge University Press, 2004.• G.W. Leibniz and Samuel Clarke: Correspondence.  Edited by Roger Ariew.

Philosophy of Language.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
155 Donner Lab.
The main purpose of this course is to answer the question, “How does language relate to the world?” In order to do this we will have to explore a lot of related questions, such as those concerning the nature of truth, reference, meaning, speech acts, metaphors, fiction, and pictures. We will also try to develop a general theoretical account of how human linguistic behavior is related to the rest of human behavior and to human mental states.There are two parts to the course. In the first part, I will explain how I think language ought to be studied philosophically. The philosophy of language is a branch of the philosophy of mind. In the second part of the course, I will teach mainstream philosophy of language, and attempt both to explain and criticize it.The main purpose of this course is to answer the question, “How does language relate to the world?” In order to do this we will have to explore a lot of related questions, such as those concerning the nature of truth, reference, meaning, speech acts, metaphors, fiction, and pictures.

Theory of Meaning.
Campbell.
MWF 10-11,
240 Mulford.
This course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein. We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege and Russell. Please note that lectures and discussions will assume that everyone present has completed one course in logic (in this the 135 course is different to the 135 course given in previous years).138 
Philosophy of Society.
Searle.
TuTh 2-3:30,
200 Wheeler.
How does human society differ from that of other social animals? How is it possible that there can be an objective reality of such things as money, property, government, marriage, and universities, even though such things exist only because we believe they exist? What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail? Are there human rights, and if so what are they and where do they come from?140A 
Intermediate Logic.
Holliday.
MWF 2-3,
110 Wheeler.
Major concepts, results, and techniques of modern logic. Basic set-theoretic tools. Model-theoretic treatment of propositional and first-order logic (completeness, compactness, Lowenheim-Skolem). Philosophical implications of these results.141 
Philosophy and Game Theory.
Buchak.
TuTh 12:30-2,
30 Wheeler.
This course deals with applications of game theory and rational choice theory to philosophical problems, as well as with paradoxes and problems introduced by these theories. After introducing the basic concepts of game theory, the first part of the course will be devoted to problems of cooperation and convention: how people manage to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit, e.g. drive on the same side of the road, carry out a project together, or use language. The next section will explore non-cooperative games, such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma; the possible application of these games to moral problems; and the need for and execution of a social contract. Finally, we turn to problems dealing with groups, such as the problem of collective action, and some issues in group decision making.153 
Chinese Philosophy.
Shun.
TuTh 2-3:30,
219 Dwinelle.
The course will focus on early Chinese philosophical thought, including different schools such as Confucianism, Daoism, Moism and Yangism. We will discuss the connotations of key philosophical terms, analyze important passages, and consider the relation between and the influence among different early Chinese thinkers. While attending closely to texts, the emphasis is on philosophical ideas in the texts. The goal is to develop an understanding of the basic ideas of the different schools of thought as well as the relevant analytic skills. The course does not require knowledge of Chinese, and all readings will be in English translation. Required readings:
D. C. Lau (trans.), Confucius: the Analects (The Chinese University Press);
D. C. Lau (trans.), Mencius (The Chinese University Press);
Burton Watson (trans.), Mozi (Columbia University Press);
Burton Watson (trans.), Chuang Tzu (Columbia University Press);

Aristotle.
Clarke.
TuTh 11-12:30,
241 Cory.
This course is an intermediate-level introduction to Aristotle. Topics include: logic and knowledge; the philosophy of change; the soul; being and substance; the notions of actuality and potentiality; the argument for a ‘prime mover’; virtue, pleasure, and friendship; the ideal political system.Required text: Irwin and Fine (trans.), Aristotle: Selections (Hackett, 1995).172 
Spinoza.
Crockett.
TuTh 2-3:30,
210 Wheeler.
This course is a close examination of the structure of Spinoza’s philosophical system. Most of our time will be spent on a careful reading of Spinoza’s Ethics Demonstrated in Geometric Order, in which Spinoza argues for a comprehensive philosophical system that encompasses metaphysics, epistemology, psychology and ethics. Our primary goal will be to come to a deep understanding of Spinoza’s philosophical views, the relation of these views to those of his contemporaries, and the relevance of his views to contemporary philosophical theories.  Our reading of the Ethics will be informed by important pieces of correspondence between Spinoza and his contemporaries.186b

A course of close reading and detailed discussion of central parts of Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations. The aim is to understand Wittgenstein’s later work and its philosophical significance by responding as directly and as sympathetically as possible to the problems and lines of thought presented in that book. Some other works of Wittgenstein and some interpretative commentary will be consulted occasionally, but the focus throughout will be on that book. Because the book embodies a conception of philosophy as a certain kind of activity, the goal of the course is to encourage philosophical reflection and engagement by everyone through careful attention to the text, active participation in back-and-forth classroom discussion. The course is meant to be as much as possible an exercise in doing philosophy, not just commentary on a philosophical work.187 
Special Topics in the History of Philosophy: Heidegger on Mitsein (Being-with) and Alterity.
Kaiser.
Tu 9-12,
234 Moses Hall.
On ‘Mitsein’ and Alterity: Heidegger’s Critique of IntersubjectivityThis course will offer a systematic study of Heidegger’s important notion of ‘Mitsein’  (‘Being-with’). Mitsein is crucial to Heidegger’s conception of Dasein in its essential tension between the poles of authenticity and inauthenticity, as well as for Heidegger’s later thinking on art, technology and language (as the ‘house of being’). But it has also been at the heart of controversies amongst both foes and followers of Heidegger’s philosophy. Thinkers as diverse and significant as Hannah Arendt, Emmanuel Levinas, Herbert Marcuse, Hans Jonas, Jürgen Habermas, and  Charles Taylor have all been profoundly influenced (positively or critically) by Heidegger’s ontological approach to grounding ethics. For some it epitomizes Heidegger’s failed attempt to capture the deeply social aspect of intersubjectivity, a failure that led to his dangerously inadequate grasp of the political dimension of human existence. To others it became a stepping stone to developing their own notions of  ‘love of the world’ or ‘amor mundi’ (Arendt), ‘alterity ‘(Levinas), and ‘responsibility’ (Jonas). We will study the relevant sections of Being and Time (in particular §§25-27 and 74) and trace Heidegger’s development of these ideas in his thinking (looking at  excerpts from Basic Concepts of Metaphysics and other lectures, as well as such influential later essays as The Thing and The Question Concerning Technology).  After that we will focus on important critical objections as well as interesting new perspectives on intersubjectivity and community by the above named philosophers and other, more contemporary thinkers.Requirements: 
• Active participation in the seminar discussion
• 2 short response papers on the assigned texts
• a 12-15 page final paper188 
Phenomenology.
Madva.
TuTh 2-3:30,

As taught this semester, this course satisfies the 160-187 (but not the 160-178) requirement for the major.This course will consist primarily in close readings of two great works in the phenomenological tradition, Heidegger’s Being and Time and Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception.  We will address questions such as:  the essence of human experience, or the first-person point-of-view;  the relationships between human beings and their physical and social environments;  the role of the body in enabling or constituting experience;  what it means to be an “authentic” versus “inauthentic” self;  the appropriate attitude to take to human finitude and mortality;  the relations between first-personal and scientific approaches to human experience; and the philosophical methodology best suited to address all of the above questions.We will also read selections from other writers, such as Husserl, Sartre, and Beauvoir.  Depending on student interest, we will conclude the course either by looking back to the historical precursors of 20th-century phenomenology, such as Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, or by looking forward to the role of phenomenology in contemporary debates in philosophy of mind, action, and cognitive science.198-1

Graduate Seminar: Political Rule.
Kolodny.
M 12-2,
234 Moses.
The political philosophy of this and the past century has tended to focus on the question: What ends should the state pursue?  Formally, the answer is: the appropriate production and distribution of goods, construed broadly to include not simply material goods, but also security, liberty, opportunity.  More substantive answers come when we specify which goods and how they are to be distributed.  This tendency is manifest in the most celebrated work of 20th century political philosophy, John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice.  That theory is, essentially, that the “basic structure” of society is just just when it distributes liberties equally and socioeconomic goods according to the “difference principle.”  However, the roots of this tendency reach deeper into the utilitarian tradition, which answers the question, “What ends should the state pursue?” with “The greatest happiness for the greatest number.”A different and earlier tradition, however, largely devoted itself to a different question.  Whatever ends the state pursues, it pursues them by issuing commands to others that are in some sense “binding”: authoritative, or obligating, or enforceable, or coercive, or some such.  Who, if anyone, has the “right” (the permission, or the normative power, or the exclusive claim) to issue such commands to whom?  Who, if anyone, has the right to rule over whom?  This is the central preoccupation of the debate between Sir Robert Filmer and John Locke, for example.Now, perhaps this tradition is misguided.  Perhaps, so long as the state is achieving the appropriate ends—which, recall, already includes an appropriate distribution of wealth, liberty, opportunity, and so forth among rulers and ruled—who rules whom, or whether anyone rules anyone, is a matter of indifference.  Our question is whether this is the whole story.  Supposing that otherwise the right ends are being achieved, is there any valid concern about the very fact that some rule over others?  What, if anything, might the concern be, and what, if anything, might answer it?We will approach these questions by asking two more familiar questions (albeit in reverse order): What, if anything, justifies the state?  And what, if anything, justifies democracy, in particular?The spine of the course, for better or worse, will be the instructor’s work in progress.  But we will also read work of greater and more lasting value, by John Rawls, Joseph Raz, Ronald Dworkin, T.M. Scanlon, and Philip Pettit, among others.290-3 
Graduate Seminar: The Nature of Nature.
Dreyfus/Noë.
W 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
Science, from its beginning, has taken inspiration from what Bernard Williams called the Absolute Conception of Reality. This is a conception of the world as “it really is” entirely apart from how it appears to us: a colorless, odorless, meaningless and value-free domain organized in accordance with timeless and immutable mathematical laws. Modern science shapes a conception of the cosmos, its subject matter, that excludes us. And so it shouldn’t be a surprise that it has proved difficult, over the centuries, to find a place for us, and for phenomena such as meaning, experience, value, purpose, not to mention religion and art, in the natural order so conceived. Maybe it’s just a matter of time. Newer sciences such as neuroscience and linguistics are moving in, step by step, on the sought after comprehension of ourselves. Or maybe the problem runs deeper than that and stems from our very conception of nature itself and so also of what a natural science is supposed to be and so what the right sort of explanations are supposed to look like?In this seminar we ask after the nature of nature. It is our aim to raise questions and to indicate possible ways forward.Among the authors whose work we will read are Thomas Nagel, Bernard Williams, Hilary Putnam, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Evan Thompson.This is a research seminar designed primarily for graduate students of philosophy. Others are welcome space permitting.290-4

An open-ended discussion-seminar exploring some necessary conditions of thought and some epistemological and metaphysical consequences of those conditions’ being fulfilled.  Areas of discussion, with special attention to the connections between them, include: awareness, discrimination, and the possession of concepts; predication, propositional thought, and the unity of judgement; assent, belief, inference, and recognition of reasons; belief, understanding, intention, and a capacity for propositonal thought; predicational competence and perceptual knowledge; conditions of self- and other-ascription of attitudes; self-consciousness, self-knowledge, and recognition of reasons.No week-by-week agenda fixed in advance.

Graduate Seminar: Primary & Secondary Qualities in Early Modern Philosophy.
Warren.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
The distinction between primary and secondary qualities is central to the development of philosophy in the 17th and 18th centuries.  We will begin by examining some of the late scholastic discussions concerning modes and qualities more generally. In the rest of the semester, we will be looking closely at a number of early modern figures, including Galileo, Descartes, Boyle, Locke, and Clarke.  On what basis do these scientists and philosophers draw the distinction between primary and secondary qualities, and where do they draw the line between them?  To what extent is the distinction based on a priori metaphysical or epistemological considerations; to what extent is it based on what an empirical physical theory says the world is like?  What is the relation of the distinction to corpuscularianism and to mechanistic explanation?  Secondary qualities are sometimes characterized as being reducible to primary qualities; sometimes, as powers to bring about ideas of certain sorts; sometimes, as merely subjective and as lacking any reality.   What is the relation between these different characterizations of secondary qualities? 290-8 
Graduate Seminar: Metaphysics&Metasemantics.
Yalcin.
W 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
This course will mix issues in metaphysics with issues in the foundations of semantics (the semantics of both artificial languages and natural language). It is about some problems concerning the relationship between reality and our ways of representing or modeling it.Some of the questions we’ll ask: What is it to model reality? How do we separate semantic facts about the way that a model is to be interpreted from the substantive theses we use the model to articulate? Are there metaphysical questions that cannot be framed except in a partially question-begging way, and if so, what is the right methodology in such cases?  How do we distinguish the artifactual features of a model from the genuinely explanatory features? In what way are the symmetry properties of a model a guide to what it is “really representing”? What is the nature of the relation between natural language and the artificial technical languages we devise in order to limb the structure of reality? What is the appropriate response to cases where natural language seems to be presupposing a "false metaphysics”? Does it even make sense to talk about natural language semantics as somehow coming with substantive metaphysical presuppositions? What is the right understanding of the models used in natural language semantics to “interpret” natural language?Readings will come from Stalnaker, Kripke, Chomsky, Humberstone, Dasgupta, Lee & Yalcin.295

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Gibson.
MTuWTh 10-12,
123 Wheeler.
When we think about how we ought to live it is perfectly natural to ask what features of the world make claims on us and give us reasons to do certain things rather than other things. Some of these features of the world seem to have a special importance, and to give rise to special reasons: that there is gratuitous suffering; that there are people we can help at very little cost to ourselves; that some are worse off than others through no fault of their own. These observations seem to give rise to special moral reasons for acting.  But what is the nature of these reasons, and what sorts of facts about the world give rise to them? Is it even correct to think that there are such facts and reasons? If there are, how can this be? In virtue of what are right actions right, wrong actions wrong? This course is an introduction to philosophical investigation of these questions. No previous experience in philosophy is required or will be assumed. The course will begin by examining a historically central question in the domain – Why be moral? – and then proceed to ask questions about the nature of moral discourse:  Are there objective ethical truths, or are all ethical claims personally or socially relative? Are ethical claims true or false like ordinary claims about the way the world is? What is the nature of moral disagreement? Then we will move on to to discuss particular theories about the content of morality. What make right actions right? What is the relationship between what is right and what is valuable? Is there one supreme duty? Lastly, we will extend this investigation into the political domain, focusing on the value of equality. What is the nature of equality? Is there some understanding of it according to which it is valuable that people be made equal, even if it imposes costs on others? Or can our aversion to great inequality be accounted for by other values? Other issues in the applied and political domains will be addressed, time permitting.   3 
Nature of Mind.
Khatchirian.
MTuWTh 12-2,
130 Wheeler.
This course is an introduction to the philosophy of mind. It is divided into three parts. In the first part, we will ask: what is it to have a mind? What kinds of properties are so-called mental properties? Can they be satisfactorily explained in terms of physical, behavioral, or functional properties of organisms? If so, how? If not, why not?In the second part of the course, we will examine the nature of our knowledge of mental states. What is the connection between knowledge of one’s own mental states and knowledge of the mental states of others? What is the connection between knowledge of one’s own mental states and knowledge of the world around us?The third part of the course concerns psychological explanation. What are we doing when we explain people’s behavior in terms of their beliefs, desires, and other contentful states? How is such explanation different from ordinary explanations of the behavior of other animals? How is it different from explanations of the behavior of inanimate objects?12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Rieppel.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
123 Wheeler.
What is it for an argument to be deductively valid? Intuitively, the conclusion must “follow from” the premises, or the truth of the premises must “guarantee” the truth of the conclusion.  In this course we will look at how this notion is made formally precise in three systems of logic: sentential logic, monadic predicate logic, and full first-order logic.  We will learn how to represent the logical forms of English arguments in each of these systems, and then develop a semantics as well as a system of natural deduction in each system to assess the validity of arguments given such formal representations.  Upon completing the course, students can expect to be familiar with the basic concepts of symbolic logic, and to be in a better position to formulate and evaluate arguments in natural languages like English. 25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Gooding.
MTuWTh 12-2,
220 Wheeler.
This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy, focusing primarily on Plato and Aristotle.  The ancient Greeks formulated many of the problems that continue to occupy philosophers, and so the course also provides an introduction to philosophical thinking in general.  But the study of ancient philosophers is exciting not only because we share many of their philosophical concerns: We will be attempting to understand a way of thinking that is, in some respects, deeply alien to our own.  By doing so, we can come to see our own philosophical assumptions and prejudices in a new light.As taught this session, the course will center on ethics (How should I live? What is the good life?) and political philosophy (How should we live together? What political arrangements are best?).  However, the systematic character of Greek philosophy — the way in which these philosophers base their ethical views on an understanding of the natural world and our place within it — means that we will also consider questions concerning the nature of reality and human knowledge.We will spend the bulk of our time examining the views of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle — and, especially, their reasons for holding those views.   We may occasionally look at certain ancient Greek poets, historians and Sophists, in the hopes of gaining a better understanding of the problems that these philosophers were addressing.  If time permits, we will also consider later Hellenistic philosophy (including the Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics).  This course presupposes no prior work in philosophy.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Crockett.
MTuWTh 10-12,
130 Wheeler.
In this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled.
By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.110 
Aesthetics.
Noë.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
200 Wheeler.
This course will explore topics in the philosophy of art. What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century).Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Noë.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
229 Dwinelle.
This is a course on the nature of mind. The central question we ask: Can we give make sense of mind as a natural phenomenon? We will read widely in philosophy and cognitive science as we seek to answer this fundamental question. Among the topics we will cover: the nature of perception and consciousness, the possibility of machine minds, neuroscience as the basic science of human experience, our knowledge of each other.178 
Kant.
Corcilius.
TuWTh 3:30-6,
122 Wheeler.
In this course we will examine some of the main themes in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. This rather demanding text gives a systematic account of the nature of our cognitive capacities with a special focus on the resulting limitations for human knowledge. We will examine Kant’s project by looking at his account of the possibility of experience, his conception of a priori knowledge, space and time, appearances vs. things in themselves, and more.
Students are required to give a short in–class presentation, and to write three short papers and a longer term paper. Philosophy 25B is highly desirable.

MTuWTh 10-12,

This course is an introduction to practical philosophy, by means of selected topics in moral and political philosophy. We begin by considering two kinds of moral theory that have dominated the contemporary scene. We will then use these theoretical frameworks to investigate the morality of abortion, and the right to privacy. In the second half of the course we consider the relationship between citizen and state. In particular, we ask whether political authority is ever justified, and consider the special case of democratic authority. The justification of action by political authorities is thought to be especially problematic in societies where there is deep disagreement, and so we end by asking about the possibility and value of toleration in diverse societies like our own.3 
Nature of Mind.
Hutchinson.
MTuWTh 12-2,

This course will serve as an introduction to the fundamental questions
in the philosophy of mind, as well as to philosophical thinking in
general.  We will be addressing such questions as: What is a mind, and what is
it to have particular mental states, such as beliefs or conscious
experiences?  How do we know about our minds and the minds of others?
What is the self, what it is to be the same person over time, and what
importance does this question have?  These questions will lead us to
the question of how our minds relate to our bodies, and how scientific
research in psychology and neuroscience should inform our thinking
about ourselves.Readings will include Descartes, Turing, Ryle, Searle, Dennett, Nagel,
Smart, Jackson, Parfit, Strawson, and others.12A 
Introduction to Logic.

The course is a requirement for philosophy majors, but will be useful to anyone interested in the principles which underlie sound reasoning.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Lawrence.
MTuWTh 10-12,
130 Wheeler.
This course is an introduction to the philosophical thought of ancient
Greece.  We will approach a broad range of philosophical questions by
examining and writing about the philosophy of Socrates, Plato,
Aristotle, and other ancient authors.  Among the questions we will ask
are: What does reality consist in, and how do we know about it?  What
is the nature of knowledge?  What is the structure of the soul?  What
is virtue, and how does one acquire it?  And what is required to lead
a good life?  We study these foundational questions of metaphysics,
epistemology and ethics through the eyes of ancient philosophers
because they were the first to ask these questions, and the first to
devise methods for answering them which are continuous with our
philosophical practice today.  For this reason, the course serves as a
good introduction to philosophical thought and method generally.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Sethi.
MTuWTh 12-2,
200 Wheeler.
This course will survey the ideas of five important philosophers of
the 17th and 18th century – Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and
Kant. We will consider how they pose and develop responses to
important metaphysical and epistemological questions that form the
basis of some of the main concerns of modern philosophy. These include
questions about the nature of reality (Does God exist? What is the
nature of the human mind? How does the mind relate to the body? Are
there causal connections in the world?), as well as the relation
between us and the world (What do we perceive? Can we come to know
things about the world through perception? Are there things we can
know to be true through reason alone? Are there limits on what we can
know?) We will attempt to develop a historical understanding of the
connections across the views we consider, as well as to
philosophically engage with and respond to each in its own right.115 
Political Philosophy.
Grosser.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
220 Wheeler.
This introductory class will examine the works of four classical protagonists of Western political thought: Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. In focusing on early modern political philosophy and, in particular, on contractarian thought, it is meant to provide students with a basic understanding of paradigmatic politico-philosophical approaches: An understanding of the underlying metaphysical and ontological, historical and anthropological assumptions that essentially inform these approaches; of the relevance and specific meaning of concepts such as freedom, justice, citizenship, or power; and, most importantly, of differing argumentative strategies of justifying the existence as well as the authority of the state philosophically. Thus, based on a careful reading of their writings, it is to be considered how Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, and Kant attempt to find a balance that resolves the inescapable tension between (individual) autonomy and (stately) authority. Additionally, the course aims at identifying the concepts of the political that, implicitly or explicitly, organize the theories discussed.119 
Feminism & Philosophy.
Madva.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
220 Wheeler.
This class is an introduction to a range of historical and contemporary feminist issues.  Is there an essential difference between women and men?  If so, what is the nature of this difference and what are its moral, social, and political implications?  If not, what explains the apparent differences?  How do questions about gender intersect with questions about race, class, religion, and cross-cultural difference?  Can a psychological account of how we tend to sort people into distinct social categories illuminate how we ought to understand these categories?  Can assumptions about gender compromise scientific objectivity?  This course introduces philosophy students to these and related questions in feminist thought, concluding with analyses of a few specific debates in contemporary feminist epistemology, ethics, and metaphysics.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California3 
The Nature of Mind.
Campbell.
MWF 2-3,
2 LeConte.
In this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.12A

Throughout we emphasize philosophical applications of logical tools and distinctions.18 
Confucius for Today.

The teachings of Confucius (6th to 5th century B.C.) have had a profound influence on Chinese and East Asian cultures, and have attracted significant interest throughout the world. In what ways are they still of relevance to life in the twenty-first century? The course will consider the contemporary implications of Confucius’ teachings for such topics as: family, rituals, life and death, fate, contentment and anxiety, anger and resentment, courage, respectfulness, modesty and humility, trustworthiness, learning, self-cultivation, semblances of virtue. In addition to reading selected passages from the Analects, we will also consider commentaries by later Confucians and read contemporary philosophical articles on the relevant topics.Required Readings

This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. It provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek philosophical thinking from the pre-Socratic beginnings to the hellenistic period. The bulk of the course will be spent on the analysis of the philosophical motives, methods and views of Socrates (469 – 399 BC), Plato (427-347 BC), and Aristotle (384-322 BC). Since the ancient Greeks identified many of the philosophical problems (and models for their resolution) we are still concerned with today, the course may also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally.39 
Freshman & Sophomore Seminar: Reading The Brothers Karamazov.
Dreyfus.
F 2-4,
106 Wheeler.
When Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov first appeared, in 1879, its first readers experience the novel as a call to personal, social, and political renewal. One reader wrote: “After the Karamazovs (and while reading it), I looked around in horror that everything went on as before, that the world did not shift on its axis…” Dostoevsky himself thought that the main question of the novel was the need for God and immortality, but many read the novel in a secular mode, asking: What is evil? Why do the innocent suffer? Where are the limits of each person’s moral responsibility for the problems of the world? Is love before logic? The novel deals with some of our deepest anxieties:  the feeling of aggression against one’s own family, rebellion against established authority, and experience of sexual desire. Today, it speaks to our experience of isolation and appeals to forces that draw human beings joyfully together. The novel does not provide answers through logical argumentation: it is a complex literary form. This team-taught seminar (cross listed in the departments of Philosophy and Slavic Languages and Literatures) will discuss the novel from the double perspective of literature and philosophy.
Feel free to register either in Philosophy 39 or Slavic Languages and Literatures 39O.There are no prerequisites. Students should be prepared for intense reading and class discussions. Hubert L. Dreyfus is Professor Emeritus and Professor of Graduate School in the Department of Philosophy. His major interests are phenomenology, existentialism, philosophy of psychology, philosophy of literature, the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence.Irina Paperno is Professor and Chair in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures.

Philosophical Methods.
Lee.
M 2-4,
182 Dwinelle.
The readings and discussion for Phil 100 in Fall 2014 will center around different philosophical views and ideas about “the self”, and the closely related notion of “person”. Is there a “self” at the center of everyone’s conscious life, and if so what is it? What distinguishes one person from another person? What is it for a person to keep existing from one moment to the next? What is death? And why is death bad? What is the moral significance of distinctions between individual people and their lives? What makes a life valuable? Finally, how is the distinction between one person and another of importance in deciding what makes for a just political system?104 
Ethical Theories.
Wallace.
MWF 11-12,
126 Barrows.
This course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy.  We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as influential work by important contemporary philosophers (including Foot, Korsgaard, Scanlon, and Williams).  Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)?  Why should we care about complying with moral demands?  What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)?  Is there anything interesting that we can say, in general terms, about what makes actions morally right or wrong?122 
Theory of Knowledge.
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,
200 Wheeler.
An upper-division course in the philosophical theory of knowledge.  Not a general survey of the field, but an investigation of three fundamental epistemological questions about perceptual knowledge.-How does what we have perceived give us knowledge of or reasonable belief in something we are not perceiving to be so at the moment?-How does what we perceive at a particular time give us knowledge of or reasonable belief in something that is so at that very time?-How does what each of us perceives give us knowledge of or reasonable belief in the thoughts, feelings, or attitudes of other people?There are apparently indisputable ways of thinking of human knowledge and perception in philosophy that raise serious challenges to satisfyingly positive answers to these questions.  The course will concentrate on the distinctively philosophical character of the epistemological problems and on how, if at all, perception, thought, belief, and knowledge must be understood to overcome the apparent obstacles to our self-understanding.Two lecture-discussion classes and one mandatory discussion section each week.  Students will be expected to write three five-page papers during the semester (one on each of the three topics) as well writing assigned in connection with discussion sections.  Lectures and discussions will presuppose close reading of the material contained in a Philosophy 122 reader (available at the beginning of the semester) as well as supplementary reading suggested at different points during the semester.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
2040 Valley.
The single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments? What is the nature of perception? This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.136 
Philosophy of Perception.
Noë.
TuTh 2-3:30,
210 Wheeler.
The philosophy of perception is a microcosm of the metaphysics of mind. Its central problems – What is perception? What is the nature of perceptual consciousness? How can one fit an account of perceptual experience into a broader account of the nature of the mind and the world? – are problems at the heart of metaphysics. It is often justifiably said that the theory of perception (and especially vision) is the area of psychology and neuroscience that has made the greatest progress in recent years. Despite this progress, or perhaps because of it, philosophical problems about perception retain a great urgency, both for philosophy and for science.140B 
Intermediate Logic.
Mancosu.
TuTh 9:30-11,
110 Wheeler.
This course covers some of the most important metalogical results that are of interest to philosophers. It is divided into three parts. The first two parts are mathematical in style whereas the last part is philosophical. In the first part we will cover the basic notions of computability theory and study in detail the Turing machine approach to computability. The second part of the course will give a detailed presentation of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and related results. Finally, we will look at the philosophical relevance of these logical results to various areas of philosophy.Prerequisite: 12A (or equivalent) or permission from the instructor.Course requirements: exercise sets approximately every ten days (counting for 60% of final grade) and a philosophical paper due at the end of the semester (40% of final grade).155 
Medieval Philosophy.
Crockett.
MWF 12-1,
20 Wheeler.
As taught this semester, this course satisfies the 160-187 (but not the 160-178) requirement for the major.This course will be a study of some of the major philosophical texts from the Medieval Period with a focus on issues in metaphysics and epistemology. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which the philosophers in this period assimilate Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy into religious thought and how they anticipate certain aspects of modern philosophy. Topics will include the nature of universals, individuation, the nature and existence of God, faith and reason, skepticism, freedom, human nature and human cognition.161 
Aristotle.
Corcilius.
TuTh 2-3:30,
20 Wheeler.
This course is an intermediate-level introduction to Aristotle. Topics include: logic and knowledge; the philosophy of change; the soul; being and substance; the notions of actuality and potentiality; the argument for a ‘prime mover’; virtue, pleasure, and friendship; the ideal political system.Required text: A New Aristotle Reader, ed. J. L. Ackrill, 1987.Recommended text: The Complete Works of Aristotle, ed. J. Barnes 2 vol. 1984 (or later).170 
Descartes.
Crockett.
MWF 3-4,
220 Wheeler.
This course will provide an intensive introduction to Descartes’s views on physics, metaphysics and epistemology. We will begin by examining some of Descartes’s early works on method, physics and physiology. We will then turn to an in-depth study of the Meditations, focusing on both Descartes’s epistemological project and his anti-scholastic metaphysics. We will supplement our study of the Meditations with readings from the Objections and Replies, the Principles, and several important pieces of secondary literature. Some of the issues we will discuss in this section include the method of doubt, the Cartesian circle, Descartes’s mode of presentation in the Meditations, the creation and ontological status of the eternal truths, the status of the human being, the nature of substance, and the real distinction between mind and body. After our study of the Meditations, we will examine Descartes’s physics as presented in the Principles.176

Schopenhauer & Nietzsche.
Kaiser.
TuTh 11-12:30,

Schopenhauer’s pessimism and Nietzsche’s forceful ‘affirmation of life’ seem to be worlds apart from each other.  On closer analysis, though, many of Nietzsche’s central theses can be understood properly only against the background of Schopenhauer’s thought.The course offers a systematic comparison of both philosophers’ interpretations of life and human existence. Particular attention will be paid to the role of art and the function of aesthetic experience in their accounts of life. Other topics to be discussed include the nature of the will and human drives; the relation between the intellectual ego and the bodily self; language and truth; and the diagnosis and evaluation of nihilism.Readings will include selections from Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation and central texts by Nietzsche from the different phases of his philosophy, including key selections from The Birth of the Tragedy, The Gay Science, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, The Genealogy of Morals and his posthumously published late notes (Will to Power).189

Proseminar in Political Philosophy and Ethics.
Munoz-Dardé.
M 9-12,
234 Moses Hall.
This course is devoted to some central questions in political philosophy and ethics: authority, neutrality, rights, equality, pluralism, consequentialism and well-being. It is focused particularly on a close reading of Joseph Raz’s The Morality of Freedom.
This is a proseminar – a novel format of class, different from most classes in our department. Instead of a standard lecture format, classes will be focused on the texts that form the basis of the course. The aim is that we should all together get to grips with these texts, making sense of what they claim and how they argue for it, by discussing collaboratively readings as we proceed. Participation is expected in every class. Classes in this format demand preparation in advance: it is essential that you do the set reading and think hard about it before each class.
This is an upper-level philosophy course. Students should be philosophy majors and must have taken at least two prior upper-division philosophy courses.
NOTE: as taught this semester, Phil190 satisfies the ethics requirement for the philosophy major.198BC-3

Graduate Seminar: Philosophy of Religion: The Nature, Ethics, & Rationality of Faith.
Buchak.
M 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
This seminar will examine different approaches, both historical and contemporary, to the question of what faith is.  Several guiding questions will be important as we examine each approach.  Is religious faith the same attitude as mundane faith?  What is the relationship between faith and belief, between faith and knowledge, and between faith and doubt?  Does having faith require going against the evidence?  When is faith rationally required or rationally impermissible?  When is faith morally required or morally impermissible?  To what extent is faith an attitude that is essential to ordinary human lives, and why? 290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Explaining Consciousness.
Lee.
W 4-6,
234 Moses Hall.
We know more than ever about the processes in the brain that give rise to conscious experience. This might lead us to hope that one day we might possess a complete “theory of consciousness”. But do we really know what form such a theory would take, or whether it is possible in principle that we could come to know it? In this seminar, we will look at some of the foundational problems that arise when we try to imagine such a theory.This will include (time permitting): (1) The problem of psycho-physical correlation: can the crude correlational information we currently possess in principle be refined into completely precise psycho-physical laws? (2) Phenomenal properties and quality spaces : many philosophers believe that experiences have “phenomenal” or “qualitative” properties that make experience hard to explain. What kind of claim is this, and could it be wrong? What exactly is it that makes the presence of such properties hard to understand?  We will look at the notion of a “quality space” and assess it’s potential for helping us understand the nature of these special properties. (3) The explanatory gap, and other special explanatory problems.  Although the well-known “explanatory gap” problem for consciousness won’t be the main focus of the seminar, we will spend at least some time discussing it.  (4) The problem of extrapolation : how, if at all, can we extend our understanding of conscious experience beyond the case of humans to other creatures and physical systems? To what extent are questions about the experience of other creatures substantive questions?290-3

Graduate Seminar: “Does the Mind Have a Causal Structure?”.
Campbell.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses Hall.
The main theses I will be exploring in this class are:A running question will be:  ‘What is the relation between our ordinary understanding of the mind, and a scientific understanding of humans?’.There are two types of philosophical objection to this picture, which suggest that psychological explanation and understanding are not merely a matter of causality:The mind is fundamentally a rational structure, and rational connections are a priori, rather than having to be discovered empirically, as causal connections are.Psychological understanding is fundamentally a matter of imaginative or empathetic understanding, and this kind of imaginative understanding is to be contrasted with causal explanation.On these views, psychological explanation and understanding are not merely forms of causal explanation and understanding.We will in general be looking at how phenomena of central interest in philosophy of mind, such as perception or consciousness, are to be described in terms of causation, and looking at current analyses of what causation as such is, in particular, analyses in terms of potential interventions, and analyses in terms of the idea of a causal process.Background reading:295

We all are acquainted with people who think they know far more about important things than they really do.  But what if we are such people?  How do we know whether our beliefs are really knowledge, or just an accumulation of superstition and half-truths inherited from parents, culture, peer-groups and the like?  Philosophers have taken such self-questioning to extremes.  Do I know that there is an external world?  That I really exist?  That the world wasn’t created five years, or five minutes, ago, with lots of misleading evidence about being older?  We will look at the structure of knowledge, doubts philosophers have had about it, and helpful positive accounts of its nature that have emerged.11 
Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion.
Buchak.
MWF 11-12,
105 North Gate.
This course addresses basic questions in the philosophy of religion, primarily from the Western philosophical tradition. For example, does God exist? Should we believe in God? What is the relationship between religious belief and scientific knowledge? How should a just God punish us for our moral wrongdoing? What is forgiveness, and what does it mean to say that God forgives? Finally, is morality based on God’s commands? The course material will be arranged topically, rather than historically, and will be divided into four sections: arguments for and against the existence of God, epistemology, metaphysics, and morality.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Mancosu.
MWF 10-11,
160 Kroeber.
The course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicates the intuitive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’) and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’). In addition, we will also develop techniques for showing when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus. Textbook: J. Barwise, J.

Modern Philosophy.
Crockett.
MWF 11-12,
145 Dwinelle.
In this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.98BC-1

Topics to be discussed include: self-respect, honor and dignity, anger and resentment, forgiveness, reverence, death, grief, fate and destiny, solitude, invulnerability, tranquility, spirituality. Readings will include articles on both contemporary philosophical approaches as well as non-western (primarily Confucian and Daoist) perspectives on these topics. 115

Is space a container and the world its contents? What is it for an object to exist at more than one time? Do other possible worlds exist?135 
Theory of Meaning.
MacFarlane.
TuTh 2-3:30,

An examination of some philosophical problems about the intentionality
of language and thought. By virtue of what are some things in the world
(for example, sentences and thoughts) about others? Is meaning always
a matter of interpretation, or do some things have meaning independently
of interpretation? Is conceptual thought prior to language? What would
it take for a computer to have thoughts? Are the meanings of our words
and the contents of our mental states determined by what’s going on
inside our brains, or do they depend also on features of our physical
and social environments? Could there be facts about meaning we could
only discover by looking in someone’s brain? Are there objective facts
about meaning at all? In exploring these and related questions, we will
read the work of Quine, Davidson, Grice, Putnam, Dennett, Searle, Burge,
Block, Fodor, Dretske, and others.138

Special Topics in Greek Philosophy.
Clarke.
MWF 11-12,

This course surveys the ideas and arguments of the first Greek philosophers, known as the “Presocratics”. Topics to be covered: Presocratic theories of the nature of the physical world; paradoxes of motion, change and plurality; views about the sources and limits of human knowledge; the beginnings of moral and political philosophy in the sophists.174 
Locke.
Crockett.
MWF 3-4,
210 Wheeler.
This course will be a close examination of one of the most important and influential books of the early modern period: John Locke’s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.  The Essay was a central source of (modern) empiricism in the 17th and 18th centuries, and paved the way for later empiricist philosophers such as Berkeley and Hume.  In it Locke discusses the “origin, certainty and extent of human knowledge,” which he uses to address problems in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of religion.  In this course we will study the arguments of the Essay while also keeping in mind the scientific and philosophical contexts in which the work was written.185 
Heidegger.
Kaiser.
TuTh 11-12:30,
30 Wheeler.
Since its publication in 1927 Heidegger’s major work Being and Time has been many things to its various recipients. Though the work has made major contributions to existential thought, hermeneutics, and post-structuralism its main concern is a revolution of what Heidegger regarded as the central term of philosophy since antiquity: the concept of being. Because he viewed the traditional understanding of this concept as superficial and misguided, his plan was (in part) to work out a new fundamental ontology. Its design was (I) to reveal the true meaning of being on the basis of temporality as its transcendental horizon and (II) to point out the crucial missteps in the tradition (Aristotle, Descartes and Kant) that led to the misconception. Heidegger never finished his ambitious project, but the work’s first part with its extensive analysis of human understanding as the basis of the conception of being was sufficient to make this work a major challenge to friend and foe alike. The course will be confined to a close study of the difficult text itself, focusing on the connection between the question of being, the analysis of human nature, and the phenomenological method that Heidegger presents as the necessary foundations of his project in Division I. We will also cover his analysis of death, conscience, resoluteness, and Dasein’s authentic potentiality for being ‘whole’, i.e. the first three chapters of Division II.Text to be used: Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, translated by John Macquarrie/Edward Robinson, paperback reprint 2008, Harper Perennial Modern Thought Series. However, we will also extensively consult the revised edition by Dennis J. Schmidt of the Joan Stambaugh translation (Suny Series in Contemporary Philosophy, 2010).186B 
Later Wittgenstein.
Stroud.
TuTh 11:00-12:30,
210 Wheeler.
Close reading and detailed discussion of central parts of Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations.  Other works by Wittgenstein and some interpretative commentary will be consulted occasionally, but the emphasis throughout will be on reading and understanding this book.  The book embodies a conception of philosophy as a certain kind of intellectual activity, so the course is likely to be of interest and value only to those willing to respond in open discussion to the problems and lines of thought presented there; those responses are themselves part of the “data” for philosophy.  This requires active engagement in discussion in class and in weekly discussion-sections and in any other setting that presents itself.

Dreyfus.
TuTh 9:30-11,
234 Moses.
Søren Kierkegaard thought of himself not as a philosopher but an “existential thinker". He was interested in how commitments open up worlds and constitute selves which are drawn to face anxiety in leaping from one sphere of existence to a higher one.Readings will include:
“Fear and Trembling”, “Sickness unto Death”, and “The Concept of Anxiety”.This course is open to Junior and Senior Philosophy Majors and will be limited to 15 students.As taught this semester, this course satisfies the 160-187 (but not the 160-178) requirement.198BC-1

Graduate Seminar: Plato’s Timaeus.
Corcilius/Clarke.
M 2-4,
234 Moses.
In his dialogue Timaeus Plato presents his philosophy of nature. Roughly speaking, the dialogue tells a ‘likely’ or ‘reasonable’ story about how intelligible structure comes to be present in the physical world. The story consists of a teleological creation myth in which we are told how the Demiurge, Plato’s divine master-builder, endows the world with order, structure and regularity because it is good. The result is the Cosmos, a divine living being distinctively marked by harmony and proportion. However, Plato’s craftsman does not create the universe out of nothing. Like every other craftsman he has to work with given materials. But the resistant nature of the still unformed and chaotic material imposes significant constraints on the process of the creation of the physical world. Thus, the Demiurge arranges everything in the best way as far as this is possible, which means, as far as the character of the found materials permits. The Timaeus provides a fairly complete picture of the Cosmos from the creation of the heavenly bodies down to the affairs of humankind. For Plato, the description of the Cosmos is not a purely theoretical project. The dialogue does not distinguish between science and value statements and it appears that this is intentionally so: for Plato, the story of the origin of the universe seems to be directly related to the question of the right human life.We will use the English translation of Donald Zeyl, in J. M. Cooper (ed.), Plato: Complete Works  (Hackett, 1997). There will be an optional Greek reading group for those interested.Reading for the first session: (1) Timaeus 17a1-27d4; (2) T. K. Johansen, Plato’s Natural Philosophy (Cambridge, 2004), Chapter 1; (3) Sarah Broadie, Nature and Divinity in Plato’s Timaeus (Cambridge, 2012), Chapter 5.290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Topics in Philosophical Logic.
Holliday.
Tu 1-3,

In this seminar, we will study alternative approaches to the semantics of propositional, first-order, and modal logic that are related to intuitionistic Kripke semantics. Topics will include: supervaluationist semantics; data semantics for epistemic modals; attempts to find a common semantical framework for classical and intuitionistic logic; possibility semantics; inquisitive semantics; truth-maker semantics; information-state semantics.290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception.
Noë.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses.
This seminar will be devoted to a close reading of Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception. The central concern of the course will be to understand Merleau-Ponty’s importance for contemporary philosophy as well as cognitive science.We will use the new Donald A Landes translation of Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge 2012). Two other books are required: Komarine Romdenh-Romluc’s Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Merleau-Ponty and Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge 2011), and Reading Merleau-Ponty, edited by Thomas Baldwin (Routledge 2007). These three books have been ordered at University Press Books, 2430 Bancroft Way, in Berkeley.We will begin in the first class with the famous “Preface” to the Phenomenology of Perception and then reread it for the last meeting in light of having read the whole text. For the first class, please also read the first chapters of Romdenh-Romluc and Baldwin.This is a graduate research course and is intended for graduate students of philosophy. It will be open to others only by permission of the instructor.290-4 
Graduate Seminar: Causation, Time, and Freedom.
Perry.
Tu 4-6,

My plan for this seminar is to read some new things on the problem of freedom and determinism, or, as I prefer, causation.  One wlll be a draft of a book I am trying to write, Wretched Subterfuge.  Jenann Ismael is also working on a new book on the topic, which I hope we can read.  She may also may be able to attend a number of the seminars.  Finally, there is a new anthology coming out editted by John Fischer, and I’ll try to get ahold of some of the papers in it.
In addition, we’ll read some of the classics, from Hume to van Inwagen, Ginet, and Wes Holliday.
As you can see, I don’t have the details worked out, but this will give potential members of the seminar what I have in mind.
If you want to read my essay “Wretched Subterfuge,” to see what sort of ideas I will be trying to develop you can download a C.V. with a link from http://john.jperry.net.  Go to item #124 (and #99 and #113, if interested).290-5 
Graduate Seminar: The Moral Nexus.
Wallace.
W 2-4,
234 Moses.
We will look at the general phenomenon of relational normativity, as well as the specific suggestion that morality might be a unified domain of relational norms. The basic idea is that some reasons or requirements have a constitutive connection with the claims or entitlements of another party. It is natural to think that some of the requirements of special relationships like friendship have this character, and it is also familiar from contractual arrangements within private law. According to the relational interpretation, this kind of relational structure is also characteristic of moral requirements, which are connected to the claims of other individuals that the agent should comply with them. A consequence is that if I violate a moral requirement, I will not merely have done something that is wrong, I will have violated a claim that someone has against me, thereby wronging them in particular. We will discuss the attractions of understanding morality in these terms, as well as the challenges that the relational interpretation faces. Among other things, we will look at some of the differences between morality and other relational domains, such as friendship and private law, which might lead to skepticism about a relational account of the moral. We will also look at some broader normative implications of understanding morality in relational terms, for issues such as imperfect duties and duties to future generations.Texts will include relevant work by Robert Adams, Stephen Darwall, H. L. A. Hart, Derek Parfit, T. M. Scanlon, Michael Thompson, Gary Watson, and Susan Wolf, as well as new draft material on the topic of the seminar by the instructor.290-6 
Graduate Seminar: Modalities of Discourse.
Yalcin.
W 4-6,

We’ll look at some new puzzles about the interaction of modality with quantification and description, using them as excuses to learn about the following topics: quantification, description, reference, counterfactual modalities, the language of knowledge, logical consequence, the semantics-pragmatics boundary, and debates about the broad shape of an adequate theory of meaning for natural language—in particular, the issue of whether it takes a dynamic form. We’ll also make contact in important ways with a question of particular interest to a number of philosophical projects, namely, the question how certain fragments of talk can fail to be fully factual.295

MTuWTh 10-12,

In this course we will raise a few of the central questions of moral and political philosophy. How should I live my life? What do I owe to others? What rules should we accept for living together? And, most fundamentally, should we think there are right and wrong answers to these questions?
We will also explore canonical answers given to these questions. Historical authors discussed in this course may include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Hume, Bentham, and Nietzsche, while more recent authors may include Bernard Williams, Judith Jarvis Thomson, John Rawls, and Robert Nozick.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Sethi.
MTuWTh 12-2,
3111 Etcheverry.
This class is an introduction to the fundamental issues in the study of mind. Appeals to mental states are ubiquitous in our every day life: “I really wanted to see the new Woody Allen movie, but I was quite disappointed.” “If you believe that equality is important, you should come to the protest on Saturday.”  “Can you give me an Aspirin, I have a splitting headache.” “I just experienced the most beautiful sunset.” Fundamental to our understanding of others and ourselves is the fact that we’re conscious beings with minds and that our conscious mental states explain our behaviors and are essential to our identities. But what is consciousness and what does it mean to have a mind? What are mental states such as beliefs and desires and perceptions? How does the mind fit into the ordinary physical universe that is composed entirely of soul-less atoms? Is there room for consciousness within a scientific worldview? Do our mental states ever genuinely cause our behavior or are they mere shadows of our purely mechanistic brains?In this class, we will learn about different views of consciousness, including Dualism, Behaviorism, Identity Theory and Functionalism. Along the way, we will consider powerful objections that have been posed to each of these views, always with an eye to understanding what the central challenge is to making room for consciousness in the natural order of things.   This is an introductory class in philosophy and so we will also learn the basic tools of philosophical thinking and writing. No prerequisites.12A 
Introduction to Logic.

Ancient Philosophy.
Gibson.
MTuWTh 10-12,
209 Dwinelle.
This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. It provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek philosophical thinking from its pre-Socratic beginnings through the works of Aristotle. The course will be divided in to four sections: We will read, discuss, and write about the views of [1] an important group of pre-Socratic thinkers, [2] Socrates (469 – 399 BC), [3] Plato (427-347 BC), and [4] Aristotle (384-322 BC) on a wide variety of topics including: the nature of the universe, how to investigate reality, the nature of knowledge, the structure of the soul, the nature of virtue, and what is required to lead a good life. Since these issues are foundational for the Western philosophical tradition, the course may also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally. This course is required for the philosophy major, but has no prerequisites, and no prior philosophical experience will be presupposed. 25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Crockett.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
209 Dwinelle.
In this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.110 
Aesthetics.
Noë.
TuWTh 10-12:30,

This course will explore topics in the philosophy of art. What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century).Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.115 
Political Philosophy.
Grosser.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
105 Latimer.
This introductory class will examine the works of four classical protagonists of Western political thought: Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. In focusing on early modern political philosophy and, in particular, on social contract theory, it is meant to provide students with a basic understanding of paradigmatic politico-philosophical approaches: An understanding of the underlying metaphysical and ontological, historical and anthropological assumptions that essentially inform these approaches; of the relevance and specific meaning of concepts such as freedom, equality, and justice, citizenship, community, and power; and, most importantly, of differing argumentative strategies of justifying the existence as well as the authority of the state philosophically. Thus, based on a careful reading of their writings, it is to be considered how Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, and Kant attempt to find a balance that resolves the inescapable tension between the autonomy of the individual and the authority of the state. Additionally, the course aims at identifying the concepts of the political that, implicitly or explicitly, organize the theories discussed.132 
Philosophy of Mind.

This is a course on the nature of mind. The central question we ask: Can we give make sense of mind as a natural phenomenon? We will read widely in philosophy and cognitive science as we seek to answer this fundamental question. Among the topics we will cover: the nature of perception and consciousness, the possibility of machine minds, neuroscience as the basic science of human experience, our knowledge of each other.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California2

How should I live?  What is worth valuing?  What does justice demand of us?  These are among the most difficult, and often disconcerting, questions that we face.  In this course, we will try to face them philosophically, by considering the answers proposed by some of the greatest thinkers in the history of the subject: Plato, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, Sidgwick and Nietzsche. This course presupposes no prior work in philosophy — only a willingness to think carefully, critically, and in an open-minded spirit.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Andrews.
MTuWTh 12-2,
156 Dwinelle.
When we focus on certain facts about ourselves, e.g. that we bleed and sneeze and have to eat, it is easy to think of ourselves as purely physical beings. This is because sneezing, bleeding and eating are all able to be understood as purely physical processes. When we think of ourselves this way we understand ourselves as, in a certain sense, ultimately the same as the tables, chairs and other things able to be purchased at Ikea: we are just hunks of matter.Other things that we do resist this sort of understanding. We feel pain, we see the light change from green to red and decide to bring the car to a stop, we have pangs of sadness, of anxiety and of jubilation. In short we have a conscious mental life the variety and quality of which is difficult to put in to words. From this perspective it is very difficult to see ourselves as merely hunks of matter, as a bunch of atoms banging around in the void. How could pain just be a bunch of atoms banging around? How could the joy I feel be a purely physical process? When we focus on our mental lives it becomes extremely puzzling how we could be purely physical in nature.Here is the question we will ask in this course: can we acknowledge the fact that we have a conscious mental life within a theoretical understanding of ourselves according to which we are purely physical in nature? Another way of asking this question is: what is the relation between the mind and the physical world? Is the mind a part of the physical world? Is our mental life just another physical process like digestion? Or is it rather that the mind is non-physical in nature and hence that it cannot be accounted for in physical terms?12A

Topics include formalization techniques, truth tables, natural deduction proofs, quantification, and model construction.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Lawrence.
TuWTh 10-12:30,

This course is an introduction to the philosophical thought of ancient Greece. We will approach a broad range of philosophical questions by examining and writing about the philosophy of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient authors. Among the questions we will ask are: What does reality consist in, and how do we know about it? What is the nature of knowledge? What is the structure of the soul? What is virtue, and how does one acquire it? And what is required to lead a good life? We study these foundational questions of metaphysics, epistemology and ethics through the eyes of ancient philosophers because they were the first to ask these questions, and the first to devise methods for answering them which are continuous with our philosophical practice today. For this reason, the course serves as a good introduction to philosophical thought and method generally.25B

Theory of Meaning.
Khatchirian.
TuWTh 10-12:30,

What distinguishes meaningful sounds and marks from meaningless ones? Are the meanings of our words to be explained in terms of the intentions with which we use them? Or are meanings determined in some other way? In what ways, if any, do the meanings of our words depend on features of our environment? Is the meaning of a word a thing in the world for which it can be said to stand? What is the relation between the meaning of a word and the meanings of sentences in which it occurs? What role, if any, should the notion of truth play in explaining what it is for our sentences to mean what they do?All of these questions presuppose that there are facts of the matter about what our words mean, or at least a difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises. But we will also examine arguments questioning these assumptions. Are there any determinate facts of the matter about what our words mean? If not, is there, after all, any real difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises? Readings will include work by Frege, Grice, Putnam, Burge, Quine, Kripke, Davidson, Searle, Strawson, Lewis, and others.160

In what ways are they still of relevance to life in the twenty-first century? The course will consider the contemporary implications of Confucius’ teachings for such topics as: family, rituals, life and death, fate, contentment and anxiety, anger and resentment, courage, respectfulness, modesty and humility, trustworthiness, learning, self-cultivation, semblances of virtue. In addition to reading selected passages from the Analects, we will also consider commentaries by later Confucians and read contemporary philosophical articles on the relevant topics.Required Readings D.C. Lau (trans.) Confucius: The Analects (The Chinese University Press) Other selected journal articles.Assignments Short essays, a short test early in the term, and a final exam.25A

This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. It provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek philosophical thinking from the pre-Socratic beginnings to the hellenistic period. The bulk of the course will be spent on the analysis of the philosophical motives, methods and views of Socrates (469 – 399 BC), Plato (427-347 BC), and Aristotle (384-322 BC). Since the ancient Greeks identified many of the philosophical problems (and models for their resolution) we are still concerned with today, the course may also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally.98BC-1

A course to encourage in philosophy majors the practice and development of the skills of reading and writing in philosophy. Readings will be drawn from recent essays on a variety of subjects in different areas of philosophy. These will be discussed in one two-hour classroom meeting each week. Students will be expected to read and discuss the essays in class and to write clearly and accurately about them and about the questions they raise. Each student will meet individually each week with a graduate student instructor for close assessment and discussion of the student’s writing with special attention to how it could be improved. There will be a final paper on a topic of the student’s choice.108 
Contemporary Ethical Issues.
Kolodny.
TuTh 11-12:30,
200 Wheeler.
Note: As taught this semester, Philosophy 108 will satisfy the Ethics requirement.As a thoughtful person, living in this country, at this time, you have at some point asked yourself some of the following questions. Should torture be allowed? Is there any difference between terrorism and “collateral damage”? May we kill enemy soldiers or even civilians to protect ourselves? Is capital punishment moral? Is abortion? Whether or not it’s moral, should it be legal? Should we let the majority or the courts decide? Is the government allowed to take your money and use it in ways you don’t want? If you have better grades and higher test scores, do you deserve a spot at UC more? Are you allowed to buy yourself an iPod when you could use the money to save people from starving? Should you buy a hybrid, rather than an SUV, when your individual choice is just “a drop in the bucket” and won’t really affect global warming?These questions can be difficult for many different reasons. Self- interest, prejudice, and fear can cloud our judgment. Religious authorities that we accept on faith, such as the Bible, can give unclear or conflicting directions. Finally, it can be hard to be sure of relevant facts: for example, whether information gained through torture tends to be reliable, whether the justice system applies the death penalty consistently, or whether burning fossil fuels leads to climate change.This course, however, is about another set of difficulties, which persist when we set aside our personal feelings, we see how far we can get without relying on faith, and we assume that we know the relevant facts. We may not be able to decide, by our own reflection and reasoning, which answers are correct, and even when we are sure that certain answers are correct, we may not be able to justify them. Our ethical ideas may seem not up to the task. Our aim in this course is to come to terms with these difficulties and to see to what extent they can be overcome.116

Regulation of Intimacy: This optional course is concerned with some central questions in political and moral philosophy. The topic of the course is the politics of sex. It focuses on general ethical concerns raised by state regulation of intimate relations. Should some things not be for sale? Is consent the key to legitimate interaction? What is involved in one person ‘objectifying’ another? Are there circumstances in which paternalism is permissible or even required? Readings include Anderson, Dougherty, Herman, Langton, Nagel, Nussbaum, Pallikkathayil, Parfit, O’Neill, Satz, Saul, Scanlon, Shiffrin, Thomson, Wedgwood. The course is intended for students with a range of specializations, but some background knowledge in philosophy. Prerequisites: two prior philosophy courses.

This course will be a survey of some ongoing debates in metaphysics. Questions we will consider will include: Why does the universe exist? Is time’s passage an illusion? Is space a container and the world its contents? What is it for an object to exist at more than one time? Do other possible worlds exist?134 
Form & Meaning.
Yalcin.
TuTh 2-3:30,
219 Dwinelle.
As taught this semester, Philosophy 134 will satisfy Group D of the Theory of Knowledge/Epistemology/Metaphysics requirement.  How is the meaning of a whole sentence determined by the meanings of its parts, and by its structure? This question is addressed in empirical semantic theories for natural language. The character and content of such theories has been a central concern both of the philosophy of language and of recent linguistics, and it is the central focus of this course. Students will become familiar with truth-conditional semantics for natural language in the model-theoretic tradition stemming from the classic work of Frege and Tarski and developed by Montague, Davidson, Lewis, and others. We will investigate the proper treatment of predicates, modifiers, quantifiers, modals, conditionals, names, descriptions, and attitudes within this kind of approach to linguistic meaning. Along this the way we will: develop a sense of what it means for a semantic theory to be compositional; ask how debates within a compositional semantic theory interact with foundational questions in the philosophy of language; and develop a conception of how natural language semantics relates to syntax, to pragmatics, and to psychological theories of human cognition.Philosophy 12A (introduction to logic) is a prerequisite to this course.136 
Philosophy of Perception.

Philosophy of Mathematics.
Mancosu.
TuTh 11-12:30,
20 Wheeler.
The course is an introduction to the classics of philosophy of mathematics with emphasis on the debates on the foundations of mathematics. Topics to be covered: infinitist theorems in seventeenth century mathematics; the foundations of the Leibnizian differential calculus and Berkeley’s ‘Analyst’; Kant on pure intuition in arithmetic and geometry; the arithmetization of analysis (Bolzano, Dedekind); Frege’s logicism; the emergence of Cantorian set theory; Zermelo’s axiomatization of set theory; Hilbert’s program; Russell’s logicism; Brouwer’s intuitionism; Gödel’s incompleteness theorems. Prerequisites: Phil 12A (or equivalent) and another course in philosophy155 
Medieval Philosophy.
Crockett.
MWF 11-12,
110 Wheeler.
As taught this semester, this course satisfies the 160-187 (but not the 160-178) requirement for the major.This course will be a study of some of the major philosophical texts from the Medieval Period with a focus on issues in metaphysics and epistemology. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which the philosophers in this period assimilate Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy into religious thought and how they anticipate certain aspects of modern philosophy. Topics will include the nature of universals, individuation, the nature and existence of God, faith and reason, skepticism, freedom, human nature and human cognition.161 
Aristotle.
Corcilius.
MWF 3-4,
122 Wheeler.
The course is an intermediate level introduction into Aristotle’s philosophy, consisting of an examination of his main philosophical writings. We will cover parts of his logic, philosophy of science, and philosophy of nature. The second part of the course will be devoted to selected topics in Aristotle’s metaphysics (substance, potentiality/actuality, and the argument for a first unmoved mover in Metaphysics XII). Requirements: 25A, active participation, and occasionally the presentation of secondary literature.  Required text: A New Aristotle Reader, ed. J. L. Ackrill, 1987. Recommended text: The Complete Works of Aristotle, ed. J. Barnes 2 vol. 1984 (or later). Other readings will be made available on bcourses.170 
Descartes.
Crockett.
MWF 3-4,
30 Wheeler.
This course will provide an intensive introduction to Descartes’s views on physics, metaphysics and epistemology. We will begin by examining some of Descartes’s early works on method, physics and physiology. We will then turn to an in-depth study of the Meditations, focusing on both Descartes’s epistemological project and his anti-scholastic metaphysics. We will supplement our study of the Meditations with readings from the Objections and Replies, the Principles, and several important pieces of secondary literature. Some of the issues we will discuss in this section include the method of doubt, the Cartesian circle, Descartes’s mode of presentation in the Meditations, the creation and ontological status of the eternal truths, the status of the human being, the nature of substance, and the real distinction between mind and body. After our study of the Meditations, we will examine Descartes’s physics as presented in the Principles.176 
Hume.
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,
126 Barrows.
A four-unit course on the philosophy of David Hume (1711-1776), treating as thoroughly as possible in the time available many of the central issues in his major works.  Students will be expected to read widely and carefully in Hume’s writings and to discuss and write clearly about them and the problems they raise.  Completion of at least Philosophy 25B is strongly advised, but not a prerequisite.  The richer one’s background in philosophy, and the more one reads and thinks and discusses with others, the more one will get from the course.  There is a large body of secondary literature on Hume that can be very helpful, but the emphasis in the course will be on the words and ideas of Hume himself.190 
Proseminar: Nietzsche on Ethics & Aesthetics.
Kaiser.
TuTh 9:30-11,
234 Moses Hall.
As taught this semester, this course may satisfy the 160-187  requirement for the major.Nietzsche’s approach to the question of the meaning of life was centered around a radical rethinking of the relation between ethics and aesthetics as the two main areas of human self-expression. Already his early account of the Apollonian and the Dionysian art drives aimed at a model that would foster both sources of energy within a productive unity. Later on in his ‘Zarathustra’ and other less ‘literary’ writings Nietzsche questions deep-seated metaphysical and psychological assumptions about selfhood and personal development. Nietzsche’s genealogical approach to morality, intertwined as it is with the question of aesthetic ‘education’, provokes us to rethink the question of valuing at the basis of ethics and aesthetics. Texts to be studied include the ‘The Birth of the Tragedy’, ‘Thus Spoke Zarathustra’, the ‘Genealogy of Morals’, and excerpts from other writings and late notes. [We will also look at some recent papers by leading Nietzsche scholars relevant to the discussed topic.]Admission to the seminar is by instructor’s approval only. If you are interested in taking the seminar please apply directly to me via email (kuk@berkeley.edu) briefly detailing in a couple of sentences the courses you’ve taken and your interest in this seminar. Decision about admission will be made by the end of June. However, a few seats will be reserved until the 1st week of the semester.198BC-1

Graduate Seminar: Space, Time and Consciousness.
Lee.
M 2-4,
234 Moses.
We will discuss some issues at the intersection of metaphysics and philosophy mind concerning space, time and consciousness. The overarching question of the course will be - what is the relationship between the fundamental spatial-temporal arena in which physical events occur, and the “manifest image” of space and time we find in human experience? More specifically, we will spend much of the course considering two recent debates. The first concerns the “spatial functionalist” position put forward by David Chalmers, on which manifest macro-spatio-temporal relations need not be the same as fundamental spatial-temporal relations. The second concerns the appearance of time’s passage: some claim that we experience the present moment as, in some sense, “moving through time”, and that this experience gives us evidence about the real nature of time. In particular, it gives us reason to believe that time involves “passage” in a strong sense (although some think the evidence is misleading - “time’s passage is an illusion”). We will assess this argument, appealing to considerations from metaphysics, philosophy of perception, epistemology, and cognitive science. 290-2 
Proof Theory.
Mancosu.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses.
The seminar will cover in detail some basic results in proof theory. We will use the original articles by Gerhard Gentzen (1909–1945), who founded both structural proof theory and ordinal proof theory. In structural proof theory we will cover, among other things, the natural deduction calculus, the sequent calculus, cut-elimination and mid-sequent theorem for the sequent calculus, and various applications of such results. In ordinal proof theory we will study, among other things, Gentzen’s consistency proof for first-order Peano Arithmetic using ordinal induction up to epsilon-zero. In addition, we will also read some other logical and philosophical articles by Gentzen and some secondary literature, where appropriate. The seminar will be of interest to philosophers, logicians, computer scientists, linguists and mathematicians. Through this material, philosophy students will acquire the tools required for tackling further debates in philosophy of mathematics (prospects for Hilbert’s program and its relativized versions etc.) and philosophy of logic and language (meaning of the logical constants; proof-theoretic semantics; realism/anti-realism, Dummett’s program (normalization, harmony etc.)). Graduate students in philosophy may use this course for satisfying the formal philosophy course requirement (i.e. a course in the 140 series or equivalent).The minimal requirement for taking the seminar is Philosophy 12A (Introduction to Logic), although a certain amount of logical/mathematical maturity (but no specific knowledge of advanced mathematics) will be necessary for mastering the material.290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Themes from the Political Philosophy of Bernard Williams.
Munoz-Dardé.
W 2-4,
234 Moses.
What should the philosophical study of the political be about? For some, the investigation of politics and political values is predominantly a matter of ‘logical analysis’. But could one really gain a proper insight into ethical ideals or political imperatives without a good sense of the historical and social settings in which they arise and continue to be expressed? If the realm of the political is defined by the common practical necessities which we all share, then a proper appreciation of our political values should also involve some historical explanation of how those necessities arise. But if so, how exactly are we to understand the relation between our political concepts (seemingly open to abstract reflection and analysis) and the historical contexts in which those concepts are embedded and out of which they arise? What role might ‘genealogy’ play in a philosophical method enriched by such historical sensitivity? Finally, once we have got used to seeking explanations in terms of our contingent histories, what room is left for offering what we can see as genuine justifications of values or policies?
These are some of the questions thrown up by Bernard Williams’s ethical and political philosophy. These concerns begin to surface in his earliest writings about political ideals, in papers on equality, freedom and toleration. But the methodological framework is given explicit formulation only much later in some of his works on both the nature of philosophy and politics. At the same time this perspective is put to work in his most practical and situated intellectual work: his reports on government committees devoted to issues ranging from education to pornography. And anyway, the reflections on the political are set in proper context only through consideration of his broader concerns with ethics and moral philosophy, particularly his critique of utilitarianism.
So the aim of this seminar is work through Williams’s puzzling away at these questions: at different points of his intellectual career; in works of concrete practical issues and the most abstract methodological reflections; in works explicitly concerned with the political, and debates about the foundations and nature of ethics.290-4 
Graduate Seminar: Experience Needed: Applying the Metaphysics of Mind.
Martin.
W 4-6,
234 Moses.
‘My earliest memory is dipped in red. I come out of a door on the arm of a maid, the floor in front of me is red, and to the left a staircase goes down, equally red. Across from us, at the same height, a door opens, and a smiling man steps forth, walking towards me in a friendly way. He steps right up close to me, halts, and says: “Show me your tongue.” I stick out my tongue, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out a jackknife, opens it, and brings the blade all the way to my tongue. He says: “Now we’ll cut off his tongue.” I don’t dare pull back my tongue, he comes closer and closer, the blade will touch me any second. In the last moment, he pulls back the knife, saying: “Not today, tomorrow.” He snaps the knife shut again and puts it back in his pocket.
Every morning, we step out of the door and into the red hallway, the door opens, and the smiling man appears. I know what he’s going to say and I wait for the command to show my tongue. I know he’s going to cut it off, and I get more and more scared each time. That’s how the day starts, and it happens very often.’This seminar has two interrelated themes. First, recent debates about the nature of action and about sensory experience have focused on the need to pay due attention to the categories in which action and experience fall: that it is important to recognize that these are events or processes as opposed to states. We’ll look at these claims – advanced by, among others, Michael Thompson, Jennifer Hornsby, Helen Steward, and Matthew Soteriou – in the context of the original views about the metaphysics of temporal entities first proposed by Anthony Kenny and Zeno Vendler, and then revised by Alexander Mourelatos.
Second, we’ll explore the role that ‘the autobiographical notion of experience’ (as Hinton labelled it) informs our common conception of the relation between sense experience, action and self-consciousness. Here too we’ll apply some morals about the categories of mental phenomena.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: Problems of Consciousness.
Searle.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses.
This seminar will be concerned with various problems in the philosophy
of mind, beginning with the problems of consciousness. We will discuss
some recent approaches to consciousness as well as some theories about
the relation of consciousness to the unconscious and the role of
mentalist explanations involving consciousness both in social sciences
and in common sense.290-6 
Graduate Seminar: Kant’s Idealism.
Warren.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses.
In this seminar, we will be focusing on Kant’s transcendental idealism, his particular version of the view that the objects of knowledge are appearances rather than things-in-themselves.    We will concentrate on the relevant sections in the Critique of Pure Reason, but we will also look at other works by Kant in order to get a better sense of the philosophical use he wants to make of idealism. We will be looking closely at the arguments Kant presents for this doctrine, with an eye to determining what role is played in these arguments by the passivity or receptivity of sensibility and what role by his views about our representation of space and time.    We will also be discussing a wide range of different interpretations of Kant’s idealism found in secondary literature by, among others, Strawson, Allison, Guyer, Langton, and Ameriks.290-7 
Graduate Seminar: Workshop in Law, Philosophy, and Political Theory.
Cohen/Song.
F 12-3,
141 Boalt Hall.
This course is designed as a workshop for the presentation and discussion of work-in-progress in moral, political, and legal theory. The central aim of the course is to provide an opportunity for students to engage directly with philosophers, political theorists, and legal scholars working on normative questions. Another aim is to create a space that brings together people from different disciplines who have strong normative interests or who speak to issues philosophers and theorists should know something about.  Toward this goal, we will devote a few sessions to featuring the work of economists, historians, psychologists, sociologists, and other social scientists.The format of the course will be as follows. For the first two hours of the course, a student will lead off with a 15-minute comment on the presenter’s paper and the presenter will have 5-10 minutes to respond before we open up the discussion to the entire assembled group.  The first two hours will be open to non-enrolled students and faculty who wish to participate in the workshop discussion. At the end of the two hours, those who are not enrolled will leave, and for the third hour of the course, the guest presenter will continue the discussion with students enrolled in the course.  Enrolled students must serve as a discussant for at least one presenter’s work-in-progress and write several short response papers and a final paper of 15-20 pages.The course is room-shared with the Law School and the Political Science Department.  This  course will follow the Law academic calendar.  The first class meeting is August 28 and the the final class meeting is December 4.(Link to Law School Calendar:  https://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/courses/academic_calendars.php)Schedule:8/28        Intro meeting (for enrolled students only)9/4          Robert Cooter, UC Berkeley Law9/11        Melvin Rogers, UCLA Political Science9/18        Edward Miguel, UC Berkeley Economics9/25        Alison McQueen, Stanford Political Science10/2        Derrick Darby, University of Michigan Philosophy10/9        Jacob Levy, McGill Political Science10/16      Seana Shiffrin, UCLA Law and Philosophy10/23      Martha Nussbaum, University of Chicago Law & Philosophy10/30      Jiwei Ci, University of Hong Kong Philosophy11/6        Ori Aronson, Bar-Ilan University Law & Berkeley Visiting Professor11/13      Avani Sood, UC Berkeley Law11/20      Amy Allen, Penn State Philosophy12/2        Final meeting (N.B.

Graduate Seminar: Foundations of Legal Philosophy.
Kutz.
Th 2-5,
2240 Piedmont.
This course is an introduction to (primarily) analytical legal theory through a close reading of some of the most important texts and arguments about the nature of law and legal authority of the last 50 years. We will pay special attention to questions of the relation of law to politics, history, and morality, and to questions about the philosophical justification (if there is) for the special role of courts in maintaining political order. Among the authors we will read are: H.L.A. Hart, Hans Kelsen, Ronald Dworkin, Jurgen Habermas, Joseph Raz, Scott Shapiro, Seana Shiffrin, and Jeremy Waldron. The course presupposes no prior work in philosophy or legal theory.295

Reading & Composition through Philosophy.
Khatchirian.
TuTh 9:30-11,
224 Wheeler.
The goal of this course is to teach students how to read and understand complex philosophical texts, how to articulate that understanding in writing, and how to analyze and critically assess philosophical arguments. Students will be expected to devote significant time and effort to writing.We will cover a range of topics. First, we will ask: what is a mind, and what is it to have a mind? Next, we will examine the connection between knowledge of one’s own mental states and knowledge of the mental states of others. We will then turn to some questions in moral philosophy: What general principles, if any, tell us what is the morally right or wrong thing to do? When does an agent deserve praise for doing the right thing? Finally, we will turn to Hume’s famous problem of induction, or, the problem of justifying our inferences from observed matters of facts to unobserved matters of fact, and we will examine contemporary responses to this problem.This course fulfills the university’s second-semester reading and composition (R&C) requirement.3 
Nature of Mind.
Campbell.
MWF 2-3,
2 LeConte.
In this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.4 
Knowledge & its Limits.
Perry.
MWF 11-12,
141 McCone.
We all are acquainted with people who think they know far more about important things than they really do. But what if we are such people? How do we know whether our beliefs are really knowledge, or just an accumulation of superstition and half-truths inherited from parents, culture, peer-groups and the like? Philosophers have taken such self-questioning to extremes. Do I know that there is an external world? That I really exist? That the world wasn’t created five years, or five minutes, ago, with lots of misleading evidence about being older? We will look at the structure of knowledge, doubts philosophers have had about it, and helpful positive accounts of its nature that have emerged.11 
Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion.
Crockett.
MWF 12-1,
2 LeConte.
The aim of this course is to apply the concepts and methodology of contemporary philosophy to basic questions in the philosophy of religion, with an emphasis on the Western philosophical and religious traditions. This includes questions concerning the nature and existence of God, the contrast between faith and reason, the nature of religious experience, the possibility of life after death, the incomprehensibility of God, and the relationship between God and morality. The course readings will primarily be contemporary, though there will be some historical readings, and the course material will be arranged topically rather than chronologically. This is a lower division course and so no prior experience in philosophy is required. 12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Yalcin.
MWF 1-2,
2060 Valley.
An introduction to the concepts and principles of deductive logic. Students will learn how to formalize basic patterns of argument and how to evaluate them for correctness systematically. The course covers the the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Time permitting, we will touch upon some metalogical results. Throughout we emphasize philosophical applications of logical tools and distinctions.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Ginsborg.
MWF 11-12,
145 Dwinelle.
The course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics. We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.98BC-1

Theory of Knowledge.
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,
210 Wheeler.
An upper-division course in the philosophical theory of knowledge.  Not a general survey of the field, but an investigation of three fundamental epistemological questions about perceptual knowledge.
-How does what we perceive give us knowledge of what is so
in the world around us at that very time?
-How does what we have perceived give us knowledge of
what is so but is not being perceived at the moment?
-How does what each of us perceives about other people give
us knowledge of the thoughts, feelings, and attitudes of
those people?
There is a long tradition in philosophy according to which the most anyone is ever aware of in sense-perception alone are certain features of our perceptual experiences, not the ways things are in the independent world we all believe in.  This has made it look as if perceptual knowledge of those aspects of the world is, strictly speaking, impossible.  This course investigates the support for this conception of perceptual experience and its “skeptical” implications for our knowledge of familiar objects around us, our knowledge of things we are not perceiving to be so at the moment, and our knowledge of other people’s thoughts, feelings, and attitudes.  The challenge is to understand how, given the distinctively philosophical character of the epistemological problems, we nonetheless do have perceptual knowledge of these aspects of the independent world. 
Two lecture-discussion classes and one discussion section each week.  Students will be expected to write three five-page papers, one on each of the three topics, as well as whatever writing is assigned in connection with discussion sections.  Lectures and discussions will presuppose close reading of the material contained in a Philosophy 122 reader (available at the beginning of the semester) as well as supplementary reading suggested at different points during the semester.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
2060 Valley.
The single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments? What is the nature of perception? This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.133 
Philosophy of Language.
Perry.

The first part of the course will be devoted to a study of early Chinese thought, with focus on Confucianism (Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi) and Daoism (Zhuangzi), though there will also be references to other schools of thought. While we will attend closely to texts, including a discussion of the connotations of key terms and an analysis of important passages, the emphasis is on philosophical ideas in the texts. All readings will be in English translation and the course does not require prior knowledge of Chinese.The second part of the course will be devoted to a philosophical discussion of themes in moral psychology that relate to Chinese thought. We will start with a methodological discussion of the way to bridge Chinese traditions of thought and contemporary philosophical discussions (primarily in the Anglo-American tradition). We will then engage in a sustained discussion of a cluster of related themes in moral psychology, such as: purity and sincerity, tranquility and equanimity, detachment, death and grief, resentment and forgiveness, acceptance as a way of coping with adversities, idea of ‘losing the self’, etc.The overall goal of the course is to provide an understanding of Chinese traditions of thought in their proper historical and cultural contexts, and to illustrate a way of doing philosophical work with these traditions that does justice to their distinctive characteristics and insights.172 
Spinoza.
Crockett.
MWF 3-4,
20 Wheeler.
This course is a close examination of the structure of Spinoza’s philosophical system. Most of our time will be spent on a careful reading of Spinoza’s Ethics Demonstrated in Geometric Order, in which Spinoza argues for a comprehensive philosophical system that encompasses metaphysics, epistemology, psychology and ethics. Our primary goal will be to come to a deep understanding of Spinoza’s philosophical views, the relation of these views to those of his contemporaries, and the relevance of his views to contemporary philosophical theories. Our reading of the Ethics will be informed by important pieces of correspondence between Spinoza and his contemporaries.178 
Kant.
Warren.
TuTh 2-3:30,
123 Wheeler.
In this course we will examine some of the major metaphysical and epistemological themes of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. We will be focusing particularly on Kant’s views on the following topics: a priori knowledge and how it is possible, space and time, objectivity and experience, self-knowledge, and transcendental idealism and the contrast between appearances and things in themselves. Several short papers and two longer papers will be required.Prerequisite: Philosophy 25B [History of Modern Philosophy (17th&18th centuries)Texts: Required: Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, translated by Norman Kemp Smith; Kant, Prolegomena, translated by Gary Hatfield; Recommended: Henry Allison, Kant’s Transcendental Idealism,  2nd edition (Yale Univ. Press, 2004)190 
Proseminar: Later Heidegger.
Kaiser.
TuTh 11-12:30,
234 Moses.
The seminar will focus on the relations between language, art, poetry, and technology in Heidegger’s later philosophy. His diagnosis of our ‘forgetfulness of being’ will be explored in the context of his interpretations of Hölderlin and Nietzsche, both of whom grappled with the ‘nihilism’ latent in modernity (‘destitute times’/’The desert grows’). Particular attention will be paid to Heidegger’s focus on the role of works of art and poetry, ‘things’, and ‘mindful thinking’ as opening up possible ways out of this condition. However, our discussion of Heidegger’s texts will also have to take into account some of the deeply troubling ‘thinking’ entries recently published in the so-called ‘Black Notebooks’.Readings will include such central essays as The Origin of the Work of Art, What are Poets for?, The Question Concerning Technology, The Thing, and On the Way to Language.Required texts: the essay collections Martin Heidegger. Poetry, Language, Thought (transl. Hofstadter), and Martin Heidegger. The Question Concerning Technology and other Essays (transl. William Lovitt). Additional texts will be made available on bCourses.Enrollment is limited, and by application only. The seminar is aimed at advanced students of philosophy, preferably with some background in Heidegger and/or Nietzsche. Students should apply to the instructor directly (at kuk@berkeley.edu). Applications should include a brief statement outlining the applicant’s philosophical background (courses taken) and interest in the seminar. All applicants will be notified via email as to the result of their application before the beginning of the new term; those admitted will receive course entry codes (CECs) with which they can enroll in the seminar through TeleBears.As taught this semester, this course satisfies the 160-187 (but not the 160-178) requirement for the major.198BC-2

Graduate Seminar: Rule-following and the normativity of meaning.
Ginsborg.
F 3-5,
234 Moses.
In his 1982 book, Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language, Kripke claims that the relation between the meaning of an expression and its use is normative rather than descriptive.  This claim has prompted a lively debate about the so-called “normativity of meaning” and the associated thesis, also sometimes ascribed to Kripke, that mental content is normative.  Do ascriptions of meaning and content have implications for how people ought to use expressions or what propositional attitudes they should be in, and, if so, what are the implications for reductionist accounts of meaning and content?  In this seminar we will investigate this debate with an eye to the question of what it might mean to say that meaning is normative: in particular, what Kripke meant by it, and what Kripke’s interpreters have understood him to mean by it.  By looking at the normativity thesis in the context of Kripke’s interpretation of Wittgenstein, we will try to get clearer about some of the positions in the debate and about whether meaning really is normative in a sense which poses a threat to semantic reductionism.  We will begin by reading Wittgenstein and Kripke; subsequent readings are yet to be determined, but are likely to include writings by some of the following: Boghossian, Millikan, McDowell, Stroud, Horwich, Brandom, Gibbard, Hattiangadi, Glüer and Wikforss.290-2 
Graduate Seminar: Some Varieties of Mental Causation.
Campbell.
Tu 2-4,
234 Moses.
Elliott Sober remarked that our ordinary concept of causation is an ‘amiable jumble’ of different ideas.  He was talking particularly about causation in biology.  Generally in current discussions of physical causation, people take it that ideas relating to probability, counterfactuals and processes or mechanisms all likely have some role to play in understanding what causation is, though of course it’s always instructive to see someone trying to do the whole thing in terms of one key concept alone.  When we consider mental causation, the ways in which mental states cause one another, do we have just the same amiable jumble, or are there quite different ideas that need to be injected?  My main point in this book is that there are some quite stark differences between physical causation and causation in the mind:(1)  In understanding physical causation, we seem to need a concept of ‘causal process’.  Similar arguments that seem to show this also apply to the mental case.  But here the concept of ‘causal process’ that we need seems strikingly different to the physical conception.(2)  In understanding high-level causation in the physical world, we seem to need a notion of ‘systematic relatedness’ of cause variables and effect variables, but the concept of ‘proportionality’ that we need in the mental case seems not quite the same as the concept we need in the physical case.(3)  In explaining what physical causation is, we seem to need some concept of ‘intervention’.  But there are differences between the types of intervention that are available in the physical case and those that are available in the psychological case.  There is some overlap, however.What underlies these differences between causality in the mind and physical causation is the difference between the mind as a target of imaginative understanding, and the physical as a target of scientific explanation, not dependent on taking the ‘point of view’ of another.Of course, what we say on these points has ramifications for virtually every topic in the philosophy of mind, from functionalism to the philosophy of perception, personal identity and freedom of the will.  The key issues in all these areas are usually framed as though we have a univocal concept of causation, which applies to both mentalistic and physical phenomena.  A better understanding of mental causation won’t of itself dissolve the original puzzles, but without it we couldn’t resolve them.  We’ll work through some of the key questions in philosophy of causation as they apply to the mentalistic case, such as the relation between causality and law, or causality and process, and we’ll look at their application to some urgent practical questions in psychiatry, as well as more familiar philosophical issues.290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Aristotle on perception and phantasia.
Corcilius.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses.
Aristotle’s theory of science crucially relies on the assumption that sense perception provides us with a reliable cognitive grasp of particular physical objects, i.e. ordinary middle sized 3-D objects such as chairs, tables, dogs, people, mountains, and so on. However, in his zoological account of sense perception in the De Anima Aristotle almost gives the impression as if he was more interested in modally specific sense perception and its causal ancestry than in the perception of objects. How does he arrive from the affection of peripheral sense organs by external objects to the perception of objects? And what exactly is the perception of objects for Aristotle? In this seminar we will examine these questions, approaching his account of sense perception at first as a part of his natural philosophy. Thus, after a very brief historical survey of earlier theories, we will start with some of the basics of his (qualitative) metaphysics of nature insofar as they are relevant for our purposes, most importantly his account of motion / change as the common actuality of the active and passive relata of change, and his idea of the perceptual soul as a principle of change. Hopefully, this will give us a sense of what he might have thought the task of a theory of perception consist in. We will then examine his account of sense perception proper, proceeding roughly along the following stages: perception and affection / the capacity – approach to perception / the material basis of perception / different kinds of ‘objects’ of perception / the individuation of the senses / perceptual discrimination and basic perceptual content / perceptual awareness as the presence of the perceptual form in the perceiver / object perception/ the roles of the imagination in perception.
Here are some (short) passages for a preparatory reading for the first few sessions: (1) De Anima I 2-5 (the discussion of the predecessors on the soul), (2) Physics III 1-3 (the definition of motion / change, or process, kinêsis), (3) De Anima II 1-4 (the most common definition of the soul, and the so-called causal definition of the soul via the powers of the soul), (4) De Anima II 5 (general introduction into the treatment of the power of perception, remarks on the relation between process and perception), (5) Physics VII 2-3 (further remarks on the relation between processes and perception, and the relation between processes and forms and states).Requirements: Phil. 161 or equivalent. 290-4 
Graduate Seminar: Meaning, Understanding and Commitment.
Stroud.
W 4-6,
234 Moses.
An exploratory seminar on the conditions, or possibility, of understanding central aspects or domains of human thought “from outside” them, without accepting or commitment to what is held to be so within the domain in question.  Particular topics to be explored in detail include: the use, meaning, and understanding of words; knowing and saying what a certain expression means; the relation between understanding an expression and competence in linguistic performance; taking something as a reason to believe, or to do, something; believing, or doing, something for a reason; making evaluative judgements; holding perceptual beliefs; having perceptual knowledge; believing that certain things are necessarily so.  For further exploration are the philosophical implications of finding oneself unable to understand or explain a particular domain of thought “from outside” it, without presupposing competence and commitment within it.Readings from the works of Nagel, Davidson, Wittgenstein, Dummett, Kripke, Quine, McDowell, Scanlon, Dworkin, Dretske, Stroud, and others.Active participation is expected of those in attendance.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: Agency, Responsibility, and Context.
Vargas.
Tu 4-6,
234 Moses.
There is a growing body of empirical and philosophical research that suggests that ordinary human agency (including moral dispositions) is profoundly affected by the structural, material, and social conditions in which agents operate. The aspiration of this seminar is to think carefully about the implications of this idea. If our moral dispositions and agential capacities aren’t just features of individual agents considered in themselves, but features of agents in contexts, this has consequences for a range of issues in moral psychology, the theory of moral responsibility, and political and legal philosophy. So, we’ll be looking at questions of blame, culpability, norm adoption, and egalitarianism in light of these and related ideas. We’ll also be considering what obligations we may have for shaping our contexts of action in light of findings about the “ecological” nature of human beings. Readings will draw from work moral psychology, ethics, decision theory, the history of philosophy, philosophy of action, and political philosophy. The seminar will start with recent work by John Doris and the instructor. Other readings may include selections from Bichierri, Hacking, McGeer, Pettit, Pippin, and Scheffler, as well as works in the social sciences, and feminist and critical theory approaches to agency. 290-6 
Graduate Seminar: Workshop in Law, Philosophy, and Political Theory.
Cohen/Hoekstra.
F 12-3,
202 Barrows.
A workshop for presenting and discussing work in progress in moral, political, and legal theory.  The central aim is to provide an opportunity for students to engage with philosophers, political theorists, and legal scholars working on normative questions.  Another aim is to bring together people from different disciplines who have strong normative interests or who speak to issues of potential interest to philosophers and political theorists.  To this end, we will devote a few sessions to the work of economists, historians, psychologists, sociologists, or other social scientists.Format: for the first two hours, a student will lead off with a 15-minute comment on the presenter’s paper and the presenter will have 5-10 minutes to respond before we open up the discussion to the group.  The first two hours will be open to non-enrolled students and faculty. For the third hour, the guest presenter will continue the discussion with students enrolled in the course.  Enrolled students must serve as a discussant for at least one presenter’s work in progress and write several short response papers as well as a final paper of 15-20 pages. The course is room-shared with the Law School and the Philosophy Department.  This  course will follow the UC Berkeley general academic calendar.  The first class meeting is January 22nd and the the final class meeting is April 29th. 295

What is the right thing to do?  In this class, we’ll explore some of the most pressing contemporary questions in ethics and political philosophy.  In the first part of the class, we’ll discuss whether we’re morally required to donate to charity, whether (assisted) suicide, abortion, and eating meat are ever permissible, and when self-defense is justified.  In the second half of the class, we’ll discuss questions of a more political nature: the ethics of punishment, killing in war, terrorism, whether and to what extent we’re required to be tolerant of others’ views (e.g., must we be tolerant even of the intolerant?), and whether living in a society that treats one unjustly licenses acting in ways that would otherwise be impermissible.  Our goal in this class is not so much to settle any of these questions than to see how to think about them philosophically, highlighting some of the major themes of ethics and political philosophy as we do so, such as the longstanding debate between utilitarian and deontological ethical theories.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Kerr.
MTuWTh 10-12,

What is it like to be a roomba, humming across the floor? Nothing. Of course, the little vacuum cleaner detects things—walls, for example. And it reacts accordingly—by turning, for example. This is, to be sure, a cute dance. But there is nothing it is like to be the dancer. The roomba doesn’t, for example, feel itself bump against the wall, or see itself turn away from it. (Go ahead and try to put yourself in the roomba’s shoes—try to imagine what it is like to be the roomba. There is nothing there to be imagined.)What is it like to be you? Here there is more to say. Of course, like the roomba, you detect things  and react accordingly. But, unlike the roomba, you also experience what’s around—you see, hear, taste, smell, and touch. What’s more, you have a rich inner life, full of thoughts, moods, and bodily sensations. You are, in short, conscious. The roomba is not. This difference between conscious and unconscious things seems deep and important. But how does it arise? What exactly is it about you that makes you conscious? And what’s missing in unconscious things, like the roomba? In this course, you will grapple with these and related questions about consciousness, and learn about philosophical (and some scientific) attempts to answer them. Along the way, you will learn how to read and write philosophy. This is an introductory course, with no prerequisites.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Buehler.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
B1 Hearst.
An introduction to the use and study of deductive logic with particular emphasis on foundational concepts and formal competence.  The primary project of the course will be a full, modern development of first-order logic alongside discussion of its relationship to intuitive ideas of proof, truth, and implication.  While a requirement for philosophy majors, this course is appropriate for anyone interested in proper reasoning, especially those intending to pursue computer science or mathematics.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Vlasits.
MTuWTh 10-12,

In this course, we will survey the beginnings of philosophy in the Western tradition with special attention to Socrates (469-399), Plato (427-347), Aristotle (384-322), and the Epicurean, Stoic, and Skeptical schools that flourished in the subsequent centuries. In particular, we will discuss their approaches to scientific knowledge, the structure of the world, and the good human life. Since the ancient Greeks identified many of the philosophical problems (and models for their resolution) we are still concerned with today, the course also serves as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Crockett.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
242 Dwinelle.
In this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.128 
Philosophy of Science.
Skokowski.
MTuW 10-12:30,

This course is an intermediate level introduction to problems in philosophy of science through readings of primary sources. We will examine several movements in recent philosophy of science ranging from logical positivism to realism and anti-realism about scientific theories and entities. We will also examine philosophical problems in specific sciences, including, for example, physics. A scientific or technical background is not required - just a philosophical curiosity about science.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Winzeler.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
136 Barrows.
This is an upper-level philosophy course focused on the mind. Science tells us that the world is made up of physical particles that follow natural laws. But how can the mind –and consciousness – fit into such a worldview? We will begin by looking at purported solutions to the mind-body problem (Dualism, Identity Theory, Behaviorism, Functionalism), noting how some of these theories have been influenced by fields like neurobiology and cognitive science. We will go on to discuss Intentionality (the mind’s ability to represent) and the related internalism-externalism debate about mental contents. Our next topic will be the epistemic puzzles related to the mind: whether there is an explanatory gap between the mental and the physical, and the problem of whether we can know anything about other minds. We will go on to talk about theories of consciousness, and we will end with a look at specific problems in the philosophy of mind: mental disorders, animal minds, and the strangeness of quantum mechanical interpretations of the mind.160 
Plato.

This will include his conceptions of philosophy, the good life, the soul, causes and explanation, the hypothesis of the Forms, his account of human knowledge and some of the developments and revisions of these conceptions. Towards the second half of the semester the discussion will focus largely on Plato’s moral psychology. Important secondary literature will be made available on bspace. No previous knowledge of Plato required. Students are expected to actively participate and to occasionally give presentations. Required text: Plato. Complete Works. Ed. J. M.

This course will be an introduction to some important questions in moral and political philosophy as well as some influential attempts to answer them.  It will be organized into three units.  In the first unit, we’ll consider questions concerning the nature of morality such as:  Are moral truths objective or rather personally or culturally relative?  Why should I act morally?  What does morality require of me?  In the second unit, we’ll look at some contemporary moral questions including:  Is abortion morally wrong?  What do we owe to future generations?  How demanding are our obligations to help strangers?  In the final unit, we’ll consider some questions in political philosophy including:  Why should I do what the state tells me to do?  What’s the nature and importance of toleration?  Why is free speech important in a political society?  3 
The Nature of Mind.
Bradley.
MTuWTh 12-2,
229 Dwinelle.
Out of all that exists in the universe, out of all of the rocks, stars, galaxies, and protons, almost nothing has any kind of mental life at all. As far as we now know, the only things in the entirety of the universe that have minds are some animals on planet Earth, ourselves included. This observation raises at least two serious questions. First, could things other than living animals like ourselves have minds, or be conscious? That’s one question, about the possible extent of mental features in the universe. A second, even deeper question, is why anything in our universe has any kind of inner mental life at all. Since so much of the universe operates in compete unfeeling darkness, why does anything in it have a mind? We are incredibly lucky to be among the things that have minds, that are conscious, that can think, feel, love, and reflect. But we, like everything else in the universe, are complex physical systems composed of mindless sub-atomic particles. Why do the mindless particles that compose my brain and body produce a conscious experience, while the mindless particles that compose a table, or a hurricane, or a galaxy generate nothing of the kind? These are both fundamental questions about what it takes for something to have a mind, which is the main them of this class. In the course we will examine some of the most fundamental questions about the nature of the mind. Topics that we will cover include the relationship between the mind and our physical bodies and brains (The Mind-Body Problem), and in particular the status of conscious experience in the physical world (The Problem of Consciousness). We will also look at the nature of perceptual experience, and the question of whether it accurately presents the world to us (The Problem of Perception), as well as the nature of the self, or the question of what a person is (The Problem of the Self). Readings will be drawn from classic and contemporary sources. Philosophers we might discuss include Descartes, Hume, Russell, Putnam, Smart, Byrne, Nagel, Chalmers, Locke, and Williams. This is an introductory philosophy course with no pre-requisites. 12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Jerzak.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
223 Dwinelle.
An introduction to the basic tools of deductive logic. You’ll learn how to represent the basic structure of arguments in a formal language, and then assess these arguments for correctness. We’ll cover the basic syntax and semantics of propositional logic and first-order logic, and develop a proof system for both. Metalogical results will be discussed but not proved. The emphasis is on using logical tools to hone everyday and philosophical reasoning.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.

This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. It provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek philosophical thinking from its pre-Socratic beginnings through the works of Aristotle. The course will be divided in to four sections: We will read, discuss, and write about the views of [1] an important group of pre-Socratic thinkers, [2] Socrates (469 – 399 BC), [3] Plato (427-347 BC), and [4] Aristotle (384-322 BC) on a wide variety of topics including: the nature of the universe, how to investigate reality, the nature of knowledge, the structure of the soul, the nature of virtue, and what is required to lead a good life. Since these issues are foundational for the Western philosophical tradition, the course may also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally. This course is required for the philosophy major, but has no prerequisites, and no prior philosophical experience will be presupposed.25B

Theory of Meaning.
Khatchirian.

What distinguishes meaningful sounds and marks from meaningless ones? Are the meanings of our words to be explained in terms of the intentions with which we use them? Or are meanings determined in some other way? In what ways, if any, do the meanings of our words depend on features of our environment? Is the meaning of a word a thing in the world for which it can be said to stand? What is the relation between the meaning of a word and the meanings of sentences in which it occurs? What role, if any, should the notion of truth play in explaining what it is for our sentences to mean what they do?All of these questions presuppose that there are facts of the matter about what our words mean, or at least a difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises. But we will also examine arguments questioning these assumptions. Are there any determinate facts of the matter about what our words mean? If not, is there, after all, any real difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises? Readings will include work by Frege, Grice, Putnam, Burge, Quine, Kripke, Davidson, Searle, Strawson, Lewis, and others.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California2

MWF 9-10,

The course deals with fundamental ethical issues and is intended, at the same time, as an introduction to philosophy.  It seeks to addresses questions concerning the self, our relations to others and our commitment to various human communities. It asks, thus: How can I lead a good life? Are there rules for my relations with others? How are we to settle questions of social living together?We will examine these issues with the help of writings from both Western and Non-Western sources, both classical and modern authors. All the required readings will be made available in a Class Reader. In addition to the lectures there will be weekly one-hour sections to provide a space for a discussion of the issues that have come up. Participation in these sections is essential for success in the class.There will be three, one hour in-class exams and a regularly scheduled three hour final.3

Man, God, & Society in Western Literature.
Dreyfus.
TuTh 2-3:30,
141 McCone.
This course will compare and contrast the Greek, Medieval and Modern worlds as expressed in their greatest literature. We will follow in detail how in the West polytheism gradually became more and more monolithic until everything was understood in relation to a single God, and then how this synthesis fell apart and left our culture with a choice between nihilism and a return to polytheism.The goal of the course is both to illustrate how to read difficult texts and to provide an understanding of the cultural paradigms that have formed and focused our shared beliefs and practices.Reading: Homer, Odyssey; Dante, Divine Comedy; Melville, Moby Dick.Requirements: An average of 100 pages of reading per week, two 7-8 page papers, a final exam, and attendance at weekly discussion sections.12A

Confucius for Today.
Shun.
MWF 3-4,

The teachings of Confucius (6th to 5th century B.C.) have had a profound influence on Chinese and East Asian cultures, and have attracted significant interest throughout the world. In what ways are they still of relevance to life in the twenty-first century? The course will consider the contemporary relevance of Confucius’ teachings for a number of selected topics. For this semester, the selected topics will revolve around the theme ‘no self’ or ‘losing the self’. In addition to reading passages from the Analects of Confucius, we will also consider elaborations on Confucius’ ideas by later Confucians, including Mencius (4th century B.C.) and Zhu Xi (1130-1200), as well as contemporary philosophical discussions of related topics such as: compassion, sympathy, empathy; humility, modesty; anger, resentment, forgiveness; detachment, tranquility. The goal is to provide an introduction to Confucius’ teachings and to key ideas in Confucian thought, as well as an understanding of the philosophical implications and contemporary relevance of Confucian ideas.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Clarke.
MWF 11-12,
145 Dwinelle.
This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. Most of the course will be devoted to the thought of Socrates (469-399 BCE), Plato (427-347), and Aristotle (384-322). We will also look briefly at the Presocratics and the Sophists, and at the major philosophical movements of the Hellenistic period: the Epicureans, Stoics, and Sceptics.Prerequisites: None.98BC-2

THIS COURSE IS RESTRICTED TO PHILOSOPHY MAJORS. It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy. Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills. This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the problem of personal identity. There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading. In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper.

Ethical Theories.
Kolodny.
TuTh 11-12:30,
101 Barker.
This course will survey major treatments of the foundational questions of moral philosophy. We will discuss the work of some or all of the following philosophers: Aristotle, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, Sidgwick, Moore, Scanlon and Korsgaard.115 
Political Philosophy.
Munoz-Dardé.
MWF 9-10,

This course is devoted to some of the central questions in contemporary political philosophy: liberty, justice and equality. The course is focused particularly on the work of John Rawls.125 
Metaphysics.
Lee.
MWF 2-3,
150 D Moffitt.
This course will be a survey of some ongoing debates in metaphysics. Questions we will consider will include: Why does the universe exist? Is time’s passage an illusion? Is space a container and the world its contents? What is it for an object to exist at more than one time? Do other possible worlds exist?135 
Theory of Meaning.
Perry.
TuTh 2-3:30,
3111 Etcheverry.
Smoke means fire. Dark clouds mean rain.  Global warming means huge populations shifts.  That extended arm means the driver is turning left.  When she said it was to my left, she really meant was to my right.  I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to do that.  “Tangible” means perceivable by though.  Do all these phenomena that we use “means” to describe, have something in common?  What have philosophers taken meaning to be?  How does the phenomenon of meaning, or the phenomena of meaning, fit into a naturalistic account of the world?  If there is smoke, but no one around to perceive it, does it still mean fire? We will discuss all of these questions and more, in the context of trying to develop a unified account of meaning based on the concept of information. 138 
Philosophy of Society.
Searle.
TuTh 9:30-11,
170 Barrows.
How does human society differ from that of other social animals? How is it possible that there can be an objective reality of such things as money, property, government, marriage, and universities, even though such things exist only because we believe they exist? What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail? Are there human rights, and if so what are they and where do they come from?140B 
Intermediate Logic.
Mancosu.
TuTh 11-12:30,
140 Barrows.
This course covers some of the most important metalogical results that are of interest to philosophers. It is divided into three parts. The first two parts are mathematical in style whereas the last part is philosophical. In the first part we will cover the basic notions of computability theory and study in detail the Turing machine approach to computability. The second part of the course will give a detailed presentation of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and related results. Finally, we will look at the philosophical relevance of these logical results to various areas of philosophy.
Prerequisite: 12A (or equivalent) or permission from the instructor.
Course requirements: exercise sets approximately every ten days (counting for 60% of final grade) and a philosophical paper due at the end of the semester (40% of final grade).155 
Medieval Philosophy.
Crockett.
TuTh 12:30-2,
140 Barrows.
As taught this semester, this course satisfies the 160-187 (but not the 160-178) requirement for the major.
This course will be a study of some of the major philosophical texts from the Medieval Period with a focus on issues in metaphysics and epistemology. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which the philosophers in this period assimilate Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy into religious thought and how they anticipate certain aspects of modern philosophy. Topics will include the nature of universals, individuation, the nature and existence of God, faith and reason, skepticism, freedom, human nature and human cognition.160 
Plato.
Long.
TuTh 12:30-2,
240 Mulford.
This course will be an in-depth study of Plato’s philosophy, focusing on two of his greatest dialogues, Republic and Theaeteus.    After an introduction on Plato’s intellectual and social context, we will spend eight weeks exploring the themes and structure of the Republic.  The work begins as a typical Socratic attempt to define a controversial term (in this case justice), and then morphs into a gigantic thought experiment involving education, theology, utopian politics, psychology, metaphysics, and eschatology.  How are we to evaluate this extraordinary project, taking it both in part and as a whole?    In the last weeks of the semester, we will study Plato’s path-breaking epistemology in the Theaetetus, paying particular attention to his refutation of epistemic relativism and Socrates’ systematic failure to define empirical knowledge.   Completion of Philosophy 25A is strongly advised.  The course will be examined by in-class mid-term and final papers, and a 5-7 page take-home essay.   Required books: Plato The Republic, ed. G.R.F. Ferrari (Cambridge University Press, ISBN 9780521484435; and Myles Burnyeat,  The Theaetetus of Plato (Hackett ): 9780915144815.176

Kant.
Warren.
TuTh 2-3:30,
150 D Moffitt.
In this course we will examine some of the major metaphysical and epistemological themes of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. We will be focusing particularly on Kant’s views on the following topics: a priori knowledge and how it is possible, space and time, objectivity and experience, self-knowledge, and transcendental idealism and the contrast between appearances and things in themselves. Several short papers and two longer papers will be required.
Prerequisite: Philosophy 25B [History of Modern Philosophy (17th&18th centuries)
Texts: Required: Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, translated by Norman Kemp Smith; Kant, Prolegomena, translated by Gary Hatfield; Recommended: Henry Allison, Kant’s Transcendental Idealism, 2nd edition (Yale Univ. Press, 2004)190-1 
Proseminar: Feminism and Philosophy.
Crockett.
TuTh 9:30-11,
234 Moses.
This seminar will be an examination of various topics at the intersection of feminist theory and philosophy.   We will begin by considering some conceptual questions in feminist theory, such as: What is feminism?  What is sexism and oppression?  What is gender?  With this background in hand we will then explore some of the contributions that feminist philosophy has made to areas of traditional philosophical interest, especially epistemology, value theory and ontology.  Readings will be drawn primarily from the writings of contemporary scholars.This seminar is intended for philosophy majors who have had at least two philosophy courses.  In special cases, however, permission to take the seminar may be granted by the instructor.198BC-2

Graduate Seminar: Aristotle’s Metaphysics Gamma.
Clarke.
M 2-4,

The fourth book of Aristotle’s Metaphysics. We will read the text in translation. Topics include: Aristotle’s conception of metaphysics (the science of being qua being); the doctrine that ‘being is said in many ways’; the principle of non-contradiction as the firmest of all principles; Aristotle’s defence of the principle of non-contradiction; refutations of Protagorean relativism and of the Heraclitean theory of flux. 290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Intuitionistic Logic and Meaning.
Holliday.
F 1:30-3:30,

Graduate seminar on intuitionistic logic. Focus will be on different semantics for intuitionistic and intermediate logics—their mathematical features and philosophical significance. Readings from Dummett, Rumfitt, and work in progress by Bezhanishvili and Holliday.290-5 
Graduate Seminar Objective and Subjective in Experience.
Martin.
W 4-6,

Graduate Seminar: Hegel, the Philosophy of Right.
Sluga.
W 2-4,
234 Moses.
Hegel’s Philosophy of Right contains a comprehensive statement of his mature political philosophy. It is also one of the best introductions into Hegel’s thinking as a whole. The Philosophy of Right begins with reflections on the concepts of freedom and the human person and proceeds from there, in a second part, to a discussion of morality, and then, in part 3, to a detailed examination of the family, civil society, and finally the state. Throughout the work, Hegel’s view is developmental and historical. The text ends therefore appropriately with a politically oriented view at “world history.”
The goal of the seminar is a careful reading of crucial sections of Hegel’s text. It will be preceded by a discussion of two related texts: Kant’s essay “Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View” and Hegel’s own “Reason in History” (the introduction to his Lectures on the Philosophy of History).
The seminar will conclude with a discussion of Karl Marx’s critical notes on the Philosophy of Right.Text: G.W.F. Hegel, Elements of the Philosophy of Right, translated by H.B. Nisbet, edited by Allen Wood, Cambridge University Press290-7 
Graduate Seminar: Workshop in Law, Philosophy, and Political Theory .
Munoz-Dardé/Cohen.
F 12-3,
141 Boalt Hall.
This course is designed as a workshop for the presentation and discussion of work-in-progress in moral, political, and legal theory. The central aim of the course is to provide an opportunity for students to engage directly with philosophers, political theorists, and legal scholars working on normative questions. Another aim is to create a space that brings together people from different disciplines who have strong normative interests or who speak to issues philosophers and theorists should know something about.The format of the course will be as follows. For the first two hours of the course, a student will lead off with a 15-minute comment on the presenter’s paper and the presenter will have 5-10 minutes to respond before we open up the discussion to the entire assembled group. The first two hours will be open to non-enrolled students and faculty who wish to participate in the workshop discussion. At the end of the two hours, those who are not enrolled will leave, and for the third hour of the course, the guest presenter will continue the discussion with students enrolled in the course. Enrolled students must serve as a discussant for at least one presenter’s work-in-progress and write several short response papers and a final paper of 15-20 pages.The course is room-shared with the Law School and the Political Science Department. This course will follow the Law academic calendar. The first class meeting is August 26 and the final class meeting is December 2.290-8

Morality and Social Justice.
Kolodny.
MWF 9-10,
Dwinelle 145.
We will survey the basic questions of moral and political philosophy, as well as some classic attempts to answer them. We will ask, among other things: What is the morally right thing for me to do? Why should I do it? Is there a fact of the matter what it is, or does it just depend on my feelings or upbringing? Why should I do what the government tells me to? Why should I tolerate alien moral beliefs and practices? We may read, among others: Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes,  Locke,  Bentham,  Mill, and Nietzsche.3 
Nature of Mind.
Campbell.
MWF 3-4,
Dwinelle 145.
Use of electronic devices (laptops, tablets, phones and so on) is not allowed in class, except by those with DSP needs.In this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a nonphysical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.12A 
Intro to Logic.
Mancosu.
MWF 10-11,
LI KA SHING 245.
The course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicates the intuitive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’) and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’). In addition, we will also develop techniques for showing when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus.

Modern Philosophy.
Crockett.
MWF 11-12,
Lewis 100.
In this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?
These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.98BC-2

This course is restricted to Philosophy majors. It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy. Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills. There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading. In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper. This term, the readings will focus on problems related to free will.107 
Moral Psychology.
Shun.
TuTh 2-3:30,
Barrows  56.
The course will examine a range of psychological phenomena related to the ethical and spiritual life of humans, drawing on both contemporary philosophical approaches as well as non-western (primarily Confucian) perspectives on these phenomena. Topics to be covered include: pride, modesty and humility; anger, resentment and forgiveness; compassion, empathy and sympathy; death, grief and acceptance; purity, detachment and tranquility; ethical self-cultivation and ethical self-indulgence. The unifying theme underlying the exploration of these topics is the idea of ‘no self’, that is, the idea that ethical self-transformation involves a move away from different forms of undue focus on the self.110 
Aesthetics .
Noë.
TuTh 11-12:30,
Barrows  56.
This course will explore topics in the philosophy of art. What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century). Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.116 
Special Topics in Political Philosophy.
Sluga.
TuTh 9:30-11:00,
Moses  234.
The course will examine some of the basic concepts of politics such as that of politics itself, the state, government, political conflict and cooperation, and power. It will focus, in addition, on technology and its role in politics, asking how governmental practices, forms of government, the conduct of war, and, indeed, the meaning and function of politics are affected by technological developments and what political challenges those developments pose.  As taught this semester, Phil 116 satisfies the ethics requirement for the philosophy major.122 
Theory of Knowledge.
Holliday.
TuTh 2:00-3:30,
Moffitt  103.
An upper-division course in the philosophical theory of knowledge. Not a general survey of the field, but an investigation of fundamental epistemological issues raised by science: the underdetermination of theory by data and its relation to skepticism; the problem of induction; and attempts to give an account of how hypotheses are confirmed by evidence.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Khatchirian.
TuTh 9:30-11:00,
McCone 141.
The single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments? What is the nature of perception? This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.133 
Philosophy of Language.
Yalcin.
TuTh 12:30-2,

This course is an advanced introduction to the philosophy of language.  Phil 12A is strongly recommended.161 
Aristotle.
Clarke.
TuTh 12:30-2:00,
Moffitt  103.
This course is an in-depth introduction to the philosophy of Aristotle. We will study selections from each of his major works. Since Aristotle was an remarkably wide-ranging philosopher, this means that we will cover a wide variety of philosophical topics. The course divides into four units: (1) The Organon; (2) The Philosophy of Nature; (3) Metaphysics; (4) Ethics and Political Philosophy.    Prerequisites: Philos 25A or an equivalent lower-level course in ancient Greek philosophy.Required text: Aristotle: Selections, trans. Terence Irwin and Gail Fine (Hackett, 1995).172 
Spinoza.
Primus.
MWF 9-10,
Moffitt  106.
In this course, we will study the distinctive metaphysical,
epistemological, psychological, and ethical positions Spinoza argues
for in his Ethics. We will analyze his arguments for monism and
necessitarianism, evaluate his response to skepticism, assess the
philosophical viability of his accounts of the human mind and human
passions, and see whether the resultant picture of what constitutes a
good human life is coherent (or attractive).186B 
Later Wittgenstein .
Stroud.
TuTh 11-12:30,
Barrows 166.
A course of close reading and detailed discussion of central parts of Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations (1953).  Other works by Wittgenstein and some interpretative commentary will be introduced occasionally, but the emphasis throughout will be on reading, understanding, and discussing this book.  The book embodies a conception of philosophy as a certain kind of intellectual activity, not simply defense of philosophical doctrines or theories, so the course is likely to be most interesting and of the greatest value to those students willing to respond in open discussion to the thoughts and lines of inquiry presented there.  Those responses themselves can serve as part of the “data” for philosophical investigation.  This requires active engagement in discussion in class and in weekly discussion-sections and in any other settings that present themselves to interested students.  The course is meant to be as much as possible an exercise in doing philosophy, not simply in studying or commenting on the philosophical views of others.189 
Special Topics in Recent European Philosophy.
Sluga.
TuTh 2-3:30,

A comprehensive discussion of the work of Michel Foucault, tracing his development from the  epistemological investigations of The Order of Things, through his concern with power and power relations in the 1970’s, to the ethics of the care of the self of Foucault’s later years. 190-1 
Proseminar: History and Philosophy of Science.
Primus.
M 1-4,
Moses  234.
This course is designed for students who want to learn about the development of modern science as well as engage directly with some broader philosophical questions the historical texts raise, questions including: What kind of knowledge does science provide? How do experiments provide evidence for theories? Is there a scientific method? What is special about scientific explanation?This seminar is intended for philosophy majors who have had at least two philosophy courses. In special cases, however, permission to take the seminar may be granted by the instructor.190-2 
Proseminar: Ethics and the Environment.
Crockett.
MW 5-6:30,
Dwinelle 210.
In this seminar we will examine a wide range of perspectives on the ethical dimensions of our relationship with the natural world and its constituents–animals, plants, ecosystems, etc.  Topics of readings and discussions will include: animal rights, the value of species and organisms, land and wilderness ethics, deep ecology, social ecology, environmental justice, ecofeminism, biocentric ethics, sustainability, population and consumption, and obligations to future generations.This seminar is intended for philosophy majors who have had at least two philosophy courses, and is limited to 15 students. In special cases, however, permission to take the seminar may be granted by the instructor.Admission to the seminar is by instructor’s approval only.  If you are interested in taking the seminar please apply directly to me via email (crickett@berkeley.edu) briefly detailing in a couple of sentences the courses you’ve taken and your interest in this seminar. Also mention if you are not a major.  You will be notified of your admission status by early December. 196 
Honors: Senior Seminar .
Kolodny.
W 2-4,
Barrows 102.
A collaborative writing workshop. Students in the honors program will develop their thesis, which they will have started to write in the fall in Philos H195. Other students will develop a paper from a previous course into a form suitable for a writing sample for applying to graduate school. Students will present drafts, followed by comments by an assigned respondent, and open discussion. As time permits, philosophical background for the work in progress may be read and discussed.Enrollment is by instructor approval.  Students who are not in the honors program, but who are interested in enrolling should email Niko Kolodny (kolodny@berkeley.edu) with: (1) a list of courses taken or in progress in philosophy, together with grades received (or an unofficial transcript); and (2) a draft, outline, or description (as much as possible at this admittedly early stage) of the paper to be developed.  Students who are in the honors program should email Kolodny for an enrollment code, but do not need to give any additional information about courses or thesis topic (which they already gave when they first enrolled in the honors program).198BC-2

We will work with texts translated in volume 1 of Long/Sedley, The Hellenistic Philosophers, supplemented by excerpts from Seneca and Epictetus, and a selection of recent articles.290-3 
Topics in Philosophy of Perception.
Lee.
Tu 2-4,
Moses 234.
This course will cover some ongoing debates in philosophy of perception, with a particular focus on foundational debates about the nature of perceptual processing and their repercussions for theories of conscious perception.We will start with the classical inferential/computational framework, looking closely at: the notion of a perceptual representation, including the notion of tacit or implicit representation of rules and information; the notion of perceptual computation; the levels of description of perceptual processes (e.g. Marr’s 3 levels); the explanatory role of content in perceptual processing; the structure of perceptual representations. We’ll draw on this to look at the recent debate about the nature and viability of Bayesian models of perceptual processing. We will also cover some recent debates about the nature of perceptual experience, including the debate about “perceptual credences”: does perceptual experience assign probabilities or levels of confidence to hypotheses about  the environment? We will also discuss what bearing, if any, different models of perceptual processing have on the debate about the metaphysics of conscious perceptual states (e.g. is disjunctivism incompatible with the classical computational model?).The reading for the course will include chapters from Nico Orlandi’s recent book “The Innocent Eye: why Vision is not a Cognitive Process”.290-4

Logicism & Neologicism.
Mancosu.
W 2-4,
Moses 234.
Description: Kant claimed that our knowledge of mathematics is synthetic a priori. Frege agreed that our knowledge of arithmetic is a priori but claimed it was analytic rather than synthetic. In addition, Frege was a platonist and held that our knowledge of arithmetic is about a special domain of mind-independent, non-spatiotemporal objects  – the natural numbers – and their characteristic properties and relations. Frege thought he could establish the a priori nature of arithmetic and platonism about its subject matter through his logicism, namely the claim that arithmetic is definitionally reducible to logic. This led him to also claim that numbers are logical objects (extensions of concepts).In the first part of the seminar, we will look at the philosophical underpinnings and technical elaboration of Frege’s logicism.  We will see how Frege motivated his logicism against rival empiricist, formalist, and Kantian views of arithmetic, and how he took his logicism to answer the philosophical problems raised by platonism.  We will look at some of the details of his technical theory. And we will see how Russell showed Frege’s theory of extensions to be inconsistent, causing Frege to abandon the project.The second part of the seminar is devoted to an attempt to revive Frege’s project that goes under the name of Neo-logicism or, now more commonly, Neo-Fregeanism or Abstractionism. A mathematical result established by Wright and foreshadowed by Frege, known as Frege’s theorem, shows how little the technical development of Frege’s logicism actually depends on the theory of extensions shown inconsistent by Russell. There has been much debate about the significance of this work.  Wright and Hale, who espouse a neologicist position, have argued that it shows that Frege’s logicist program can be salvaged, with slight modifications, into a philosophically satisfying account of arithmetic.  Boolos, Heck, Dummett, and others have argued the contrary position. The discussion has been raging since the publication of Wright’s book “Frege’s conception of numbers as objects” (1983) and it is still the focus of great interest in much contemporary philosophy of mathematics. In addition to study some classic sources (including Wright’s 1983 book), we will also discuss several very recent contributions to Neo-logicism.Prerequisites:   The seminar is open to all graduate students in Philosophy and Logic and Methodology of Science.  Interested undergraduates, visiting students, etc. should seek the permission of the instructor before enrolling.  I will presuppose that everyone has had a good introductory course in first-order logic, at the level of Philosophy 12A.  Previous coursework in logical metatheory, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of language, Kant, and Frege may be helpful but are not required.290-6

Workshop in Law, Philosophy, & Political Theory.
Kutz.
F 12-3,
202 Barrows.
This course is designed as a workshop for the presentation and discussion of work-in-progress in moral, political, and legal theory. The central aim of the course is to provide an opportunity for students to engage directly with philosophers, political theorists, and legal scholars working on normative questions. Another aim is to create a space that brings together people from different disciplines who have strong normative interests or who speak to issues philosophers and theorists should know something about.  Toward this goal, we will devote a few sessions to featuring the work of economists, sociologists, and even a biologist (to talk about the ethics of genetic editing).  
    The format of the course will be as follows.  For the sessions with guest presenters, lunch will be served starting at 12:00.  We’ll begin at 12:15.  A designated commentator will lead off with a 15-minute comment on the presenter’s paper.  The presenter will have 5-10 minutes to respond and then we will open up the discussion to the entire assembled group.  The first part of the course will be open to non-enrolled students and faculty who wish to participate in the workshop discussion. We’ll stop for a break at 1:45 and those not enrolled in the course will leave. Enrolled students will continue the discussion with the guest presenter from 2:00 to 3:00. 
    This is a room-shared course. Students may enroll through the Law School or the Philosophy or Political Science Departments.  290-8 
Foundations of Moral Philosophy.
Kutz.
Tu 2:10-5,
2240 Pied 102.
This course aims to provide a “graduate level introduction” to contemporary moral philosophy.  That is, it is intended to supply students with little or no prior philosophical background with a working knowledge of major themes and debates in moral philosophy.  It takes its organizing theme the topic of claims of moral, political, and legal rights, and looks to how deontological (Kantian) and consequentialist (Mill’s utilitarianism) theories can support or limit those claims.  In this part of the seminar, we will move back and forth between concrete examples of rights (for example, rights against torture, and rights to free speech), and more abstract treatments in both the classical and contemporary canonical literature. We will also take up questions of moral knowledge and the relevance of perspective (including gendered perspectives).290-9 
Plato’s Euthydemus.

The seminar will work through Plato’s unjustly neglected dialogue, the Euthydemus, examining its analysis of sophistry and the relation (or the failure of relations) between the sophistic arguments and the Socratic discussion of virtue and knowledge. We shall consider the connections between the Euthydemus and other Platonic dialogues (notably Meno, Republic and Theaetetus) and reflect on Aristotle’s account of the sophistic arguments in his Sophistical Refutations.295

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Kaplan.
MTuWTh 12-2,

Questions of individual morality and social justice are questions not about how things are, but about how they ought to be. We will study some of these questions, and traditional attempts to answer them. In addition to studying philosophy, we will also do philosophy. That is — while being informed by the answers and arguments given by Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Bentham, Mill, Nietzsche, and others — we will attempt to state and defend our own answers to these questions.  Here are some examples of the questions will will discuss: What is the morally right thing to do?  Why should I do the morally right thing?  Is there a moral law that applies to everyone, or is it relative in some way?  Why, if at all, should I obey the law? Why, if at all, should I tolerate beliefs and practices other than my own? There are no prerequisites for taking this course.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Bradley.
MTuWTh 10-12,

What is it like to be a roomba, humming across the floor? Nothing. Of course, the little vacuum cleaner detects things—walls, for example. And it reacts accordingly—by turning, for example. This is, to be sure, a cute dance. But there is nothing it is like to be the dancer. The roomba doesn’t, for example, feel itself bump against the wall, or see itself turn away from it. (Go ahead and try to put yourself in the roomba’s shoes—try to imagine what it is like to be the roomba. There is nothing there to be imagined.)
What is it like to be you? Here there is more to say. Of course, like the roomba, you detect things and react accordingly. But, unlike the roomba, you also experience what’s around—you see, hear, taste, smell, and touch. What’s more, you have a rich inner life, full of thoughts, moods, and bodily sensations. You are, in short, conscious. The roomba is not.
This difference between conscious and unconscious things seems deep and important. But how does it arise? What exactly is it about you that makes you conscious? And what’s missing in unconscious things, like the roomba?
In this course, you will grapple with these and related questions about consciousness, and learn about philosophical (and some scientific) attempts to answer them. Along the way, you will learn how to read and write philosophy. This is an introductory course, with no prerequisites.12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Lawrence.

An introduction to the use and study of deductive logic with particular emphasis on foundational concepts and formal competence. The primary project of the course will be a full, modern development of first-order logic alongside discussion of its relationship to intuitive ideas of proof, truth, and implication. While a requirement for philosophy majors, this course is appropriate for anyone interested in proper reasoning, especially those intending to pursue computer science or mathematics.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Vlasits.
MTuWTh 10-12,
Hearst Field Annex B5.
In this course, we will survey the beginnings of philosophy in the Western tradition with special attention to Socrates (469-399), Plato (427-347), Aristotle (384-322), and the Epicurean, Stoic, and Skeptical schools that flourished in the subsequent centuries. In particular, we will discuss their approaches to scientific knowledge, the structure of the world, and the good human life. Since the ancient Greeks identified many of the philosophical problems (and models for their resolution) we are still concerned with today, the course also serves as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Crockett.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
Dwinelle 215 .
In this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?
These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.135 
Theory of Meaning.
Khatchirian.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
Dwinelle 223.
What distinguishes meaningful sounds and marks from meaningless ones? Are the meanings of our words to be explained in terms of the intentions with which we use them? Or are meanings determined in some other way? In what ways, if any, do the meanings of our words depend on features of our environment? Is the meaning of a word a thing in the world for which it can be said to stand? What is the relation between the meaning of a word and the meanings of sentences in which it occurs? What role, if any, should the notion of truth play in explaining what it is for our sentences to mean what they do?
All of these questions presuppose that there are facts of the matter about what our words mean, or at least a difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises. But we will also examine arguments questioning these assumptions. Are there any determinate facts of the matter about what our words mean? If not, is there, after all, any real difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises? Readings will include work by Frege, Grice, Putnam, Burge, Quine, Kripke, Davidson, Searle, Strawson, Lewis, and others.170 
Descartes.
Crockett.
TuWTh 1-3:30,

An intensive introduction to Descartes’s views on physics, metaphysics and epistemology through examination of Descartes’ early works on method, physics and physiology. This includes an in-depth study of the Meditations, focusing on both Descartes’ epistemological project and his anti-scholastic metaphysics supplemented by readings from the Objections and Replies, the Principles, and several important pieces of secondary literature. Issues discussed include the method of doubt, the Cartesian circle, Descartes’ mode of presentation in the Meditations, the creation and ontological status of the eternal truths, the status of the human being, the nature of substance, mind-body dualism and Descartes’ physics as presented in the Principles.

In this course, we will survey the basic questions of moral and political philosophy, as well as some classic attempts to answer them.  The questions that we will ask include: What is the morally right thing for me to do?  Why should I do it?  Is there a fact of the matter what it is, or does it just depend on my feelings or upbringing?  Why should I do what the government tells me to?  Why should I tolerate alien moral beliefs and practices?  The philosophers whose work we will read include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Bentham, Mill, and Nietzsche.3

This course is an introduction to themes in the philosohy of mind and cognitive science. Readings will be taken from philosophy and cognitive science. The course will explore a radical proposal: that the mind is not in the head, that the brain is not the mind, that you are not your brain. A wealth of findings in empirical science and philosophy point in this direction. This course is organized around this issue.4 
Knowledge & Its Limits.

Matrix? Is our knowledge built on a foundation or are we floating on a raft,
or does our knowledge have the structure of a teepee? What are the
requirements for knowledge? How much do we need to trust others in order to
know? Can we trust ourselves? Do animals have knowledge?12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Fitelson.
MWF 1-2,

Logic is about reasoning, the difference between good and bad  reasoning, and how to tell the difference between good and bad  reasoning.In this course, we will develop techniques for laying bare the  structure of arguments (“reasonings”). This will enable us then to  characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and  bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These  three things — a conception of structure of arguments, a precise  characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their  structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning — constitute a  “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of  logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to  properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we  will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of  the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in  typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put  into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which  the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a  conclusion.Textbook: Modern Logic by Graeme Forbes, Oxford University Press, 1994.24 
Freshman Seminar: The Ethics of Mortality.
Wallace.
M 11-12,

This seminar will consider whether and under what conditions it might be morally permissible to kill another person. We will consider a variety of situations in which killing has been thought to be morally justified, such as self-defense, the conduct of a just war, the administration of justice (capital punishment), and the alleviation of acute suffering (euthanasia). In considering the permissibility of killing under these various circumstances we will be forced to address fundamental questions about the nature of morality and the value of human life. Readings will be taken from contemporary philosophical discussions (available in a course reader). Students will be expected to attend all seminar meetings and to participate in seminar discussions. In addition, there will be two short papers (1-2 pages). 1 unit; P/NP.25A

our time on Socrates (469-399 BC), Plato (427-347 BC), and Aristotle
(384-322 BC), with a passing glance at pre-Socratic and Hellenistic
philosophers. Our primary goal will be to understand each philosopher’s
characteristic methods and views, and (more importantly) his reasons
for holding these views.100

A course to encourage in philosophy majors the practice and development of the skills of reading and writing in philosophy.  Readings will be drawn from recent essays on a variety of subjects in different areas of philosophy.  These will be discussed in one two-hour classroom meeting each week.  Students will be expected to read and discuss the essays in class and to write clearly and accurately about them and about the questions they raise.  Each student will meet individually each week with a graduate student instructor for close assessment and discussion of the student’s writing with special attention to how it could be improved.  There will be a final paper on a topic of the student’s choice.115

It will focus, in particular, on the concept of the political and argue that our traditional understanding of that concept has now disintegrated and that we must endeavor to conceive of politics in new ways.In the course of this undertaking we will look at the writings of a number of political philosophers, including specifically Plato and Aristotle as well as Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, and Micheal Foucault.Texts:Plato   Protagoras and Meno.

Required Text: : Contemporary Readings in the Foundations of Metaphysics, edited by S, Lawrence & C. Macdonald (Blackwell: 1998).
This course will survey some of the main issues discussed by contemporary analytic philosophers in connection with fundamental questions about ontological commitment. We will start by considering what it is for a person or a theory to be committed to the existence of something. This will lead naturally to an inquiry into the status of possible objects and worlds, abstractions and properties, substances, events and individual nonrecurrent unit properties (tropes). The lectures will assume familiarity with the following readings from the text:(I) METHODOLOGY & ONTOLOGICAL COMMITMENT:Introduction: Metaphysics and Ontology [Laurence & Macdonald, 1-7]

Philosophy of Mind.
Searle.
TuTh 8-9:30,

The single most important question in philosophy – and in intellectual life generally – at the present time is this:  How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles?
    This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind.  What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes?  How does it function causally in our behavior?  How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes?  What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action?  Do we have free will?  Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will?  Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings?  Are our brains really just digital computers?  How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments?  This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.  135 
Theory of Meaning.
Campbell.
TuTh 2-3:30,
159 Mulford.
This course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein.  We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege and Russell.  Prerequisite: two previous courses in philosophy.142 
Philosophical Logic.
Mancosu.
TuTh 9:30-11,

The course aims at introducing students to the basic topics in philosophy of logic. Topics to be covered will be selected from among the following: theories of truth, logical consequence, modal notions (necessity/possibility) and possible world semantics, vagueness, quantification, existence and descriptions, first vs second-order logic, extensionality vs intentionality, realism and antirealism in logic.Prerequisites (no exceptions!): Phil 12A (or equiv) and at least another course in philosophy.160 
Plato.
Frede.
TuTh 12:30-2,

This course will be devoted to a close examination of the development of Plato’s theory of Forms from itd first traces in early dialogues to possible revisions in later dialogues.  The examination will also include questions of the development in Plato’s epistemology and method of dialectic.  We will discuss the treatment of these topics in Plato’s Euthyphro, Meno, Phaedo, Republic, Parmenides, Sophist, and the Philebus.  167 
Introduction to Chinese Philosophy.
Heller.
MWF 12-1,
30 Wheeler.
This course will acquaint students with key thinkers from the Zhou dynasty through the end of the Qing dynasty.  While the course is arranged chronologically, we will also take up more thematic considerations, such as the development of statecraft, the idea of the self, and the discourse on kinship.  Much of class time will be devoted to careful readings of primary sources in translation, with attention to major themes and modes of argument.  In addition to preparing for class discussion, students will be asked to write three short papers (approximately three pages each).  The first of these will be a close reading of a short passage selected by the student.  The second short paper will compare the treatment of an idea or theme in two sources, and the third paper will examine the historical trajectory of a key term or theme.  In addition there will be an in-class midterm and a final exam.178 
Kant.
Warren.
TuTh 2-3:30,
110 Wheeler.
In this course we will examine some of the major metaphysical and epistemological themes of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. We will be focusing particularly on Kant’s views on the following topics: a priori knowledge and how it is possible, space and time, objectivity and experience, self-knowledge, and the contrast between appearances and things in themselves. Several short papers and a longer paper will be required. Prerequisite: Philosophy 25B200

You seem to be subject to two different kinds of “ought”: two different kinds of normative demand.  On the one hand, you are subject to demands that the world makes on you.  Some fact of your situation, we might say, is a /reason /for you to believe or do something.  Because the hunter was caught red handed, you have reason to believe that he was poaching.  Because Moses Hall is on fire, you have reason to leave.  On the other hand, you are subject to demands that your attitudes make on one another, however the world may be.  Some attitude that you have, we might say, makes it /irrational /of you to have or fail to have some other attitude, whether or not you have reason for or against any of those attitudes.  Because you believe that Berkeley is west of San Francisco, it would be irrational of you to believe that Berkeley is east of San Francisco.  Because you intend to vote for Nader, it would be irrational of you to fail to intend to go to the polling station.  The topic of this seminar is the relation between these two kinds normative demand.290-3 
The Philosophy of Mathematical Practice.
Mancosu.
Th 2-4,
234 Moses.
Contemporary philosophy of mathematics offers us an embarrassment of riches. Among the major areas of work one could list developments of the classical foundational programs (neo-logicism, modified Hilbert’s program, varieties of constructivism etc.), analytic approaches to epistemology and ontology of mathematics (nominalism, platonism etc.), and developments at the intersection of history and philosophy of mathematics (Lakatos and others). But anyone even partially familiar with contemporary philosophy of mathematics will not have failed to notice a loud call for approaches to the philosophy of mathematics that will pay closer attention to mathematical practice than has hitherto been the case. The seminar will focus on this latter direction of work. It will be divided into two parts. The first part will cover some approaches to the philosophy of mathematical practice from the 1960s to the 1990s (Lakatos, Kitcher, and Maddy, among others). The second part will consist of readings from a new generation of philosophers of mathematics whose appeal to mathematical practice differs in significant ways from those studied in the first part of the seminar. Most of the readings for the second part will come from a forthcoming volume, “The Philosophy of Mathematical Practice”, which I am editing for Oxford University Press. Among the topics to be covered are diagrammatic reasoning, visualization, explanation, purity of methods, fruitfulness of concept, etc. Time permitting, some attention will be devoted to the philosophical problems emerging from developments in category theory, computer science, and mathematical physics. 290-4 
Meaning, Understanding, and the Attribution of Attitudes.

A seminar devoted to discussion of the questions: What is involved in (a) a person’s meaning something determinate by 
an expression?
   (b) a person’s understanding an expression in a 
determinate way?
   © our attributing such a meaning or 
understanding to someone?The goal is to explore the capacities for meaning and understanding that we implicitly attribute to those to whom we attribute propositional and other attitudes.  A large part of the seminar (as much as is needed) will be devoted to detailed discussion of most of Saul Kripke’s Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language.  Close reading of that book will be presupposed.  Other readings will be drawn from some of the many responses to that book and from elsewhere.The intention of the seminar is to carry on a general, focussed discussion of these questions and their implications wherever they seem interesting.  Active participation by all those in attendance is expected.  Suggestions of topics to be discussed, or presentations suggested by participants, are welcome.  There is no fixed agenda for the seminar.  These issues have been at the center of much philosophical discussion for some years, and this seminar is an opportunity to discuss them as things stand now.Required reading: Saul A.

Aristotle’s Ethics.
Frede.
W 2-4,

The course will work out the basic principles of Aristotelian ethics. It will focus on the con-cept of happiness or well-being and the requisite virtues.  It will also elucidate the Aristotelian explanation for the phenomenon called ‘weakness of the will’, his conception and evaluation of pleasure, the importance of friendship, and take up the controversy whether Aristotle’s ex-planation of the supreme good represents a tension in his system.

Dreyfus/Ginsborg.
F 3-5,

Our focus will be on McDowell’s and Merleau-Ponty’s views on perception and action.  We will spend the first third of the semester focussing on McDowell’s Mind and World (1994) and on readings immediately related to it.  In the middle part of the semester we will read extracts from Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception (1945/1962).  Readings for the third part of the semester are still to be determined but will probably include some of McDowell’s more recent writings, and also some recent work and draft writings by one or both of the instructors.295

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Haddow.
MTuWTh 10-12,
Barrows 140.
In this course, we will address the basic questions of ethics. How should we live? What is a good human being like, and what kind of life so they lead? We’ll address these big questions by focusing on some slightly smaller ones: by what standard are some actions right and other wrong? Is a moral life (necessarily) a free and authentic one? Or does morality present some kind of threat to our freedom or authenticity? To what extent is living an ethical life under our control? What kinds of emotions and desires do ethical people have, and what role do they play in their lives? Throughout the class, we will connect our discussion of these general questions to contemporary ethical issues concerning race and gender. Our readings will be drawn from a wide variety of philosophical traditions: among others, we will read Simon de Beauvoir, John Stuart Mill, Iris Murdoch, Aristotle, Marth Nussbaum, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Confucius.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Suarez.
MTuWTh 12-2,
Dwinelle 182.
This course is an introduction to the philosophy of mind. We’ll read texts that address the following questions: What is the mind? Is the mind an immaterial soul? How are our minds and bodies related? How do we know about other people’s minds? Is the mind the same as the brain? Is the brain a computer? Is the mind a program? What is consciousness? Can we explain consciousness scientifically? Is it possible for our minds to switch bodies? Should we worry about whether our bodies survive, or whether our memories do? What is the self? Is there really a self? What is free will? Do we have free will?12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Rudolph.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
GPBB 103.
This course is an introduction to the tools of formal logic, with the goal of using them to evaluate arguments. We will cover the syntax and semantics of sentential and first-order logic, and develop proof systems for both. This will give us the tools to symbolize natural language arguments in both formal languages, assess arguments for validity, and give deductive proofs. Overall, we will be developing resources to think precisely about what makes for good and bad reasoning, in both everyday and philosophical contexts.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Gibson.
MTuWTh 10-12,
GPBB 107.
This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. It provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek philosophical thinking from its pre-Socratic beginnings through the works of Aristotle. The course will be divided in to four sections: We will read, discuss, and write about the views of [1] an important group of pre-Socratic thinkers, [2] Socrates (469 – 399 BC), [3] Plato (427-347 BC), and [4] Aristotle (384-322 BC) on a wide variety of topics including: the nature of the universe, how to investigate reality, the nature of knowledge, the structure of the soul, the nature of virtue, and what is required to lead a good life. Since these issues are foundational for the Western philosophical tradition, the course may also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally. This course is required for the philosophy major, but has no prerequisites, and no prior philosophical experience will be presupposed.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Hutchinson.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
GPBB 107.
In this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?
These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.110 
Aesthetics.
Noë.
TuWTh 1-3:30,
Barrows 155.
This course will explore topics in the philosophy of art. What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century). Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.125 
Metaphysics.
Yalcin.
TuWTh 3:30-6,
Dwinelle 229 .
What is reality like in itself, considered independently from our thought or experience of it? Questions of this sort arise for specific domains. For instance: does mind-independent reality fix the truths of morality? Or is morality really some sort of projection of our attitudes, or some kind of human invention? Do things have colors independently of us, or do we “gild or stain all natural objects with the colours, borrowed from internal sentiment”, as Hume put it? Is causation a real thing, or does it merely seem to be, owing to the way we happen to apprehend the world? Do things have necessary or essential properties independently of our modes of thinking and talking about them? What even are properties — how do they fit into reality? And what about familiar entities of everyday life, like persons and material objects — can we arrive at a conception of their nature entirely in abstraction from our ways of thinking and perceiving such things? Metaphysics is characterized by a special preoccupation with questions like these — and with the meta-question of whether such questions can even be answered. 132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Noë.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
Dwinelle 215.
This is a course on the nature of mind. The central question we ask: Can we give make sense of mind as a natural phenomenon? We will read widely in philosophy and cognitive science as we seek to answer this fundamental question. Among the topics we will cover: the nature of perception and consciousness, the possibility of machine minds, neuroscience as the basic science of human experience, our knowledge of each other.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California2 
Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Sluga.
MWF 9-10,
Hearst Field Annex A1.
The course deals with fundamental ethical issues and is intended, at the same time, as an introduction to philosophy. It seeks to addresses questions concerning the self, our relations to others and our commitment to various human communities. It asks, thus: How can I lead a good life? Are there rules for my relations with others? How are we to settle questions of social living together?We will examine these issues with the help of writings from both Western and Non-Western sources, both classical and modern authors. All the required readings will be made available in a Class Reader.3 
The Nature of Mind.
Noë.
TuTh 9:30-11,
Dwinelle 145.
Introduction to the philosophy of mind. Topics to be considered may include the relation between mind and body; the structure of action; the nature of desires and beliefs; the role of the unconscious. 5 
Science and Human Understanding.
Dasgupta.
MWF 10-11,
Stanley 106.
This course will survey a range of philosophical topics relating to modern science. Topic 1: Science and Religion. Is there a scientific explanation of our existence? Does the “Fine Tuning” of the laws of physics imply that the universe was designed by a creator to support life? Topic 2: Science and Society. What is the role of science in a democracy? What obligations do scientists have to citizens, and citizens to scientists? Topic 3: The Philosophy of Computer Science. Elon Musk recently said that we probably live in a computer simulation—is he right? What is the “singularity” and how should we prepare for it? What is the ethical status of an artificial intelligence? Topic 4: The Metaphysics of Science. Does science discover a read-made world that exists “out there”, independently of us? When biologists sort organisms into species, are they carving the world “at its natural joints” or do their categories more reflect their own way of thinking? Topic 5: The Epistemology of Science. Scientists typically extrapolate from data, making predictions about the future that have not yet been observed. Is there any non-circular argument that their predictions will be reliable? If not, does this mean that science is ultimately based on faith? The course is designed for students across the university; no prior knowledge of philosophy or science is required. 12A

Ancient Philosophy.
MacFarlane.
MWF 12-1,
Li Ka Shing 245.
This course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy–and, for the uninitiated, to philosophy itself. We will spend almost all of our time on the three most important Greek philosophers–Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle–with a passing glance at pre-Socratic and Hellenistic philosophers. Our primary goal will be to
understand these philosophers’ characteristic methods and views, and (more importantly) their reasons for holding these views. It is often said that we should study ancient Greek philosophy because it is the intellectual basis for all later western philosophy and natural science. That is true, but it is only half the story. We should also study ancient Greek philosophy to become familiar with a worldview so alien that it throws our own into sharp relief. As you are outraged by some of the things these philosophers say, you will come to see more clearly what your own views are, and you will be forced to ask what justifies them. You will not just be studying the history of philosophy; you will be doing philosophy. Prerequisite: None.98BC-2

This course is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy. Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills. This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the problem of personal identity. There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading. In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper. Text: Personal Identity, edited by John Perry, University of California Press104 
Ethical Theories.
Wallace.
MWF 10-11,
Birge 50.
This course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy. We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as influential work by important contemporary philosophers (including Foot, Korsgaard, Scanlon, and Williams). Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)? Why should we care about complying with moral demands? What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)? Is there anything interesting that we can say, in general terms, about what makes actions morally right or wrong?108 
Contemporary Ethical Issues.
Crockett.
MWF 2-3,
Barrows 56.
This course will be devoted to in-depth discussion of a variety of problems in moral philosophy raised by real-life questions of individual conduct and social policy. Its contents will vary from occasion to occasion. Possible topics include philosophical problems posed by affirmative action, abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, terrorism, war, poverty, and climate change. Note: As taught this semester, Philosophy 108 will satisfy the Ethics requirement.117AC 
Philosophy of Race, Ethnicity, and Citizenship.
Kolodny.
MWF 11-12,
LeConte 3.
This course explores philosophical questions of race, ethnicity, and citizenship, with special attention to the experiences of African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, and indigenous peoples of the United States.  Topics include the meaning of “race,” “ethnicity,” and “citizenship,” border control and immigration, reparations for past wrongs, discrimination and affirmative action, civic obligation and group solidarity, and the right to vote.We define ourselves, or are defined by others, as members of social groups: for example, as a U.S. citizen, as Latina, as African American, as Yurok, as sansei, and so on.  Needless to say, our real or perceived membership in these groups affects what we can expect of others and what they expect of us.•       If you are a U.S. citizen, then you may stay within the U.S. as long as you like, you may vote in a variety of elections, but you will be required to pay tax on foreign income.  The same will go for your children.  If you are not a U.S. citizen, then you may be deported for a crime, you may not vote in most elections, but you will not be required to pay tax on foreign income.  The same will go for your children, unless you happen to give birth to them in a U.S. hospital.•       If you were of Japanese descent, living on the West Coast during the Second World War, then you were most likely confined in an internment camp.  If you survived until 1988, then you were sent an apology and $20,000 from the federal government.•       In Plessy v. Ferguson, the US Supreme Court decided, roughly, that the State of Louisiana could count the fact that you had an ancestor who would today be described as “African American” as a (decisive) reason to keep you from sitting in certain railway cars.  In Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the US Supreme Court permitted, roughly, the State of California to count the fact that you were African American as a (partial) reason to admit you to medical school.•       If you are Latino/a, living in certain neighborhoods, then you may find other Latinos/as offering to drive you to the polls on Election Day, when they wouldn’t if you were Anglo, living in another neighborhood.  If, on the way, they find out that you can’t speak Spanish, or you support Donald Trump, they may ask you to explain yourself, in a way they wouldn’t if you were Anglo, living in another neighborhood.This course is not about the fact, important though it is, that our real or perceived membership in such groups affects what others do to us and what they expect us to do for them.  Instead, this course asks when and why, if ever, our real or perceived group membership ought morally to affect what others do to us and what they expect us to do for them.We will begin discussion of each topic with stage-setting readings, drawn from law and history, to help us to understand the real-world, and distinctively American, contexts in which these moral questions have arisen.  However, we will approach these topics not as lawyers or historians, but instead as moral philosophers.  The focus will be on making precise, deciding among, and ultimately justifying the underlying values and principles that might answer these moral questions.125 
Metaphysics.
Lee.
TuTh 11-12:30,
Barrows 166.
This course will be a survey of some ongoing debates in metaphysics. Questions we will consider will include: Why does the universe exist? Is time’s passage an illusion? Is space a container and the world its contents? What is it for an object to exist at more than one time? Do other possible worlds exist?132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Khatchirian.
TuTh 9:30-11,
Barrows 126.
In this course, we will take up central problems concerning the nature of mind and examine contemporary approaches to these problems. We will ask the following questions: Can science explain consciousness? If not, can we still make sense of consciousness as part of the natural world? Can we make sense of thought as part of the natural world? What are we doing when we attribute thoughts to ourselves and to others? Are beliefs and desires real? Are they genuine causes of behavior? What role, if any, does our environment play in fixing the contents of our thoughts? And where is the mind anyway? Is it located where our brain or body is located, or does it extend beyond our body?140A 
Intermediate Logic.
Warren.
MWF 2-3,
Wheeler 204.
Major concepts, results, and techniques of modern logic. Basic set theoretic tools. Model theoretic treatment of propositional and first-order logic (completeness, compactness, Lowenheim-Skolem). Philosophical implications of these results. 153 
Chinese Philosophy.
Shun.
TuTh 2-3:30,
Barrows 56.
The course will focus on early Chinese philosophical thought, including different schools such as Confucianism, Daoism, Moism and Yangism. Thinkers to be considered include Confucius, Mozi (Mo Tzu), Yangzhu (Yang Chu), Mencius, Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu) and Xunzi (Hsun Tzu). We will discuss the connotations of key philosophical terms, analyze important passages, and consider the relation between and the influence among different early Chinese thinkers. While attending closely to the primary texts, the emphasis is on philosophical ideas in these texts, and we will explore some of these ideas in relation to the contemporary philosophical literature. The overall goal of the course is to provide an understanding of Chinese traditions of thought in their proper historical and cultural contexts, and to illustrate a way of doing philosophical work with these traditions that does justice to their distinctive characteristics and insights.172 
Spinoza.
Crockett.
MWF 11-12,
Barrows 56.
This course is a close examination of the structure of Spinoza’s philosophical system. Most of our time will be spent on a careful reading of Spinoza’s Ethics Demonstrated in Geometric Order, in which Spinoza argues for a comprehensive philosophical system that encompasses metaphysics, epistemology, psychology and ethics. Our primary goal will be to come to a deep understanding of Spinoza’s philosophical views, the relation of these views to those of his contemporaries, and the relevance of his views to contemporary philosophical theories. Our reading of the Ethics will be informed by important pieces of correspondence between Spinoza and his contemporaries.178 
Kant.
Warren.
TuTh 2-3:30,
Wheeler 204.
In this course we will examine some of the major metaphysical and epistemological themes of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. We will be focusing particularly on Kant’s views on the following topics: a priori knowledge and how it is possible, space and time, objectivity and experience, self-knowledge, and transcendental idealism and the contrast between appearances and things in themselves. Several short papers and two longer papers will be required.184

Kaiser.
M 9-12,
Moses 234.
A study of some central themes from 20th Century German aesthetics, focusing on works by Benjamin, Heidegger, Adorno, and other figures. Some topics to be discussed: (1) what constitutes art – from paradigm to anything goes? (2) art in its essential tension “between Avantgarde and Kitsch”; (3) art as criticism of “reality” and “understanding”; (4) art and history: truth-happening or emancipatory practice; (5) how does art “speak”? or art in language and art as language.Course Requirements:
An oral presentation and an accompanying short handout (15-20 minutes). 
Active participation in seminar discussions
A final paper (of approximately 5,000 words)Readings will be made available on the bCourses website before the beginning of the term.Admission by application only: If you are interested in taking the proseminar, please write the instructor (at kuk@berkeley.edu) and briefly outline your background (the courses already taken in philosophy, including your grades, if you are willing to share them) and your current interests.

The topic of this seminar is Aristotle’s Peri ideôn or On Ideas, his lost treatise on Platonic Forms. In this treatise Aristotle described and then criticized a series of Platonic arguments for the existence of Forms. (One of Aristotle’s criticisms was the famous “Third Man” objection.) Our knowledge of the Peri ideôn is largely dependent on Alexander’s commentary on the first book of the Metaphysics. We will be reading the relevant part of Alexander’s commentary alongside related passages in Aristotle and in Plato.Required text: Gail Fine, On Ideas (Oxford)290-3 
Graduate Seminar: Wittgenstein’s Rule-Following Considerations.
Ginsborg.
Tu 4-6,
Moses 234.
This seminar will attempt to get to grips with the “rule-following considerations” presented in Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations and in other texts. These considerations raise questions about what it is to follow a rule and to grasp the meaning of an expression. They have been taken by some commentators, including Kripke, to present a skeptical argument undermining the very possibility of rule-following and of meaning.Our primary focus will be the passages which are typically taken as central to the rule-following considerations (Investigations §§185-242), but we will look at these in the context of material from earlier in the Investigations and of other work of Wittgenstein, in particular Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics. Depending on time and the interest of the participants we will also read some of the relevant secondary literature, including work by Dummett, Stroud, Wright, McDowell, Ebbs, Goldfarb and Kripke290-4 
Graduate Seminar: Art, Nature, Experience.
Noë.
W 4-6,
Moses 234.
This seminar will be devoted to a close reading of writings by John Dewey and Maurice Merleau-Ponty on the topic of art. Both thinkers frame their understanding of art against the background of accounts of experience and the natural world. Dewey and Merleau-Ponty held that it is only possible to understand art and its place in human life if you have an adequate conception of experience and nature. In addition, they seem to have believed that art itself may be a medium for arriving at that adequate conception. The texts for this course will include:  Art As Experience, by John Dewey (Penguin/Perigree, 1934); The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader: Philosophy and Painting, (edited by Galen A. Johnson Northwestern University Press, 1993); Sense and Non-sense, by Maurice Merleau-Ponty, (edited by Hubert Dreyfus and Patricia Allen Dreyfus. Northwestern University Press, 1964). In addition, we will read selections from The Phenomenology of Perception, by Maurice Merleau-Ponty (Translated by Donald A Landes, Routledge, 2012), as well as writings by other authors.290-5 
Graduate Seminar: Monisms.
Primus.

Law, Philosophy, and Political Theory.
Cohen/Song.
F 12-3,
Boalt 141.
Cross-listed as LAW 210.2A-001 and POLSCI 211-001.This course is a workshop for discussing work-in-progress in moral, political, and legal theory. The central aim is to enable students to engage directly with philosophers, political theorists, and legal scholars working on normative questions. Another aim is to create a space that brings together people from different disciplines and perspectives — including economists, sociologists, and political scientists as well as journalists — who have strong normative interests or who speak to issues philosophers and theorists should know something about. In Fall 2017, the workshop will focus on “borders, citizenship, and immigration.” A list of confirmed presenters is below.The format of the course will be as follows. For the sessions with guest presenters, lunch will be served starting at 12:00. We’ll begin at 12:15. A designated commentator will lead off with a 15-minute comment on the presenter’s paper. The presenter will have 5-10 minutes to respond and then we will open up the discussion to the group. The first part of the course will be open to non-enrolled students and faculty who wish to participate in the workshop discussion. We’ll stop for a break at 1:45 and those not enrolled in the course will leave. Enrolled students will continue the discussion with the guest presenter from 2:00 to 3:00.This is a room-shared course. Students may enroll through the Law School (Law 210.2), Philosophy Department (Philosophy 290), or the Political Science Department (PS 211). The first class will meet on Friday, August 25.Schedule:

Cross-listed as LAW 215.42-001This course is an introduction to (primarily) analytical legal theory through a close reading of some of the most important texts and arguments about the nature of law and legal authority of the last 50 years. We will pay special attention to questions of the relation of law to politics, history, and morality, and to questions about the philosophical justification (if there is) for the special role of courts in maintaining political order. Among the authors we will read are: H.L.A. Hart, Hans Kelsen, Ronald Dworkin, Jurgen Habermas, Joseph Raz, Scott Shapiro, Seana Shiffrin, and Jeremy Waldron. The course presupposes no prior work in philosophy or legal theory.295

In this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.4 
Knowledge & Its Limits.
Holliday.
TuTh 2-3:30,
Evans 60.
In this course, we will investigate questions about the nature and limits of knowledge: Is knowledge compatible with the possibility of human error? Is the structure of our knowledge like a building that rests on a foundation or like a web held together by its connections? What are the requirements for knowledge? Can one know by accident? How can we acquire knowledge and avoid misinformation from others? Whom can we trust?12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Warren.
MWF 1-2,
Evans 10.
This course is intended to introduce the student to the concepts and principles of deductive logic: symbolizing English language sentences and arguments in terms of formalized languages; validity, implication, and equivalence in truth-functional and quantificational logic; systems of deduction, and their soundness and completeness. In addition to the three lectures, each student will attend two sections per week.Requirements: Lecture and section attendance, weekly problem sets, several in-section quizzes, a midterm and a final.Text: Warren Goldfarb’s Deductive Logic, Hackett, 2003.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Primus.
MWF 10-11,
Lewis 100.
In this course, we will study works by central figures in 17th and 18th century philosophy, including Descartes, Elisabeth, Spinoza, Locke, Conway, Leibniz, Hume, and Kant. Topics will include the relation of the self to the world, the possibility and extent of one’s knowledge, the nature of bodies and causation, and the relationship of theology to philosophy.98BC-1

Moral Psychology.
Shun.
MWF 3-4,
Wheeler 204.
The course will examine a range of psychological phenomena related to the ethical and spiritual life of humans, drawing on both contemporary philosophical approaches and Confucian thought. Topics to be covered include: pride, modesty and humility; anger, resentment and forgiveness; compassion, empathy and sympathy; death and acceptance; purity, detachment and tranquility; as well as other selected topics. The unifying theme underlying the exploration of these topics is the idea of ‘no self’, that is, the idea that ethical self-transformation involves a move away from different forms of undue focus on the self.This class is restricted to Philosophy majors during Phase I enrollment.128 
Philosophy of Science.
Dasgupta.
TuTh 11-12:30,
Wheeler 204.
This course will investigate how our concepts of space, time, and chance have been shaped by developments in modern science. Topics may include: (1) What does physics teach us about the structure of space? (2) Is there a scientific explanation of the flow of time? (3) Are quantum mechanical chances objective or just measures of subjective uncertainty? (4) What about chances in high-level sciences like biology and economics? Along the way, we’ll use these discussions as gateways into more general issues in the philosophy of science such as realism vs anti-realism, the nature of scientific laws, and the demarcation problem. By the end, we’ll have worked our way towards a certain picture of how the different sciences hang together as a unified whole. As taught this semester, Phil 128/190, can satisfy group A of the Epistemology/Metaphysics requirement.This class is restricted to Philosophy majors during Phase I enrollment.133 
Philosophy of Language.

Theory of Meaning.
Campbell.
TuTh 9:30-11,
Dwinelle 219.
This course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein. We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege and Russell.Please note that lectures and discussions will assume that everyone present has completed one course in logic (in this the 135 course is different to the 135 course given in previous years).This class is restricted to Philosophy majors during Phase I enrollment.143 
Modal Logic.
Holliday.
TuTh 11-12:30,
Barrows 60.
An introduction to the logical study of modality in its many forms: reasoning about necessity, knowledge, obligation, time, counterfactuals, provability, and other modal notions. Covers core concepts and basic metatheory of propositional modal logic, including relations to first-order logic; the basics of quantified modal logic; and selected philosophical applications ranging from epistemology to ethics, from metaphysics to mathematics.Pre-requisite: PHILOS 12A or equivalent. 161 
Aristotle.
Clarke.
TuTh 12:30-2,
Wheeler 204.
This course is an in-depth introduction to the philosophy of Aristotle. We will study selections from each of his major works, covering a wide range of philosophical topics. The course divides into four units: (1) The Organon; (2) The Philosophy of Nature; (3) Metaphysics; (4) Ethics and Political Philosophy.This class is restricted to Philosophy majors during Phase I enrollment.173 
Leibniz.
Crockett.
MWF 11-12,
Wheeler 204.
This course will be a detailed examination of the philosophical writings of the 17th century philosopher G.W. Leibniz, with an emphasis on his metaphysical views in relation to those of Descartes and (especially) Malebranche. Topics will include Leibniz’s theodicy, as well as his views on the relation between mind and body, the nature of space and time, the relation between our representations of the world and the world as it is in itself, the nature of substance and material reality, the relation between God and creation, the nature of inter- and intra-substantial causality, the nature of ideas and intellectual cognition, and the unity of organic entities.This class is restricted to Philosophy majors during Phase I enrollment.185 
Heidegger: Being and Time.
Kaiser.
MW 6:30-8,
Wheeler 204.
Since its publication in 1927, Heidegger’s major work Being and Time has been many things to its various recipients. Although the work became enormously important for the development of phenomenology,  hermeneutics, existential thought, and post-structuralism, its main concern was a revolution in what Heidegger regarded as the central concept of philosophy since antiquity: that of being. Because he viewed the traditional understanding of this concept as superficial and misguided, his plan was (in part) to work out a new fundamental ontology. Its design was (I) to reveal the proper meaning of being on the basis of temporality as its transcendental horizon and (II) to point out the crucial missteps in the tradition (Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant) that led to the deeply problematic contemporary conception of being. Heidegger never finished this ambitious project, but the work’s first part—with its extensive analysis of human understanding as the basis of the conception of being—was sufficient to make Being and Time an essential text for friend and foe alike. The course will be devoted to a close study of this challenging, influential, and fascinating work. We will focus on the connection between the question of being, the analysis of human nature, and the phenomenological method that Heidegger presents as the necessary foundation of his project in Division I of Being and Time. We will also cover his analysis of death, conscience, resoluteness, and Dasein’s authentic potentiality for being ‘whole’, i.e. the first three chapters of Division II.Main text: Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, translated by John Macquarrie/Edward Robinson, paperback reprint (Harper Perennial Modern Thought Series, 2008). However, we will also consult the revised edition by Dennis J. Schmidt of the Joan Stambaugh translation of Being and Time (SUNY Series in Contemporary Philosophy, 2010).This class is restricted to Philosophy majors during Phase I enrollment.190 
Proseminar: Epistemology.
Khatchirian.
MWF 10-11,
Dwinelle 279.
In this seminar, we will address some central questions in epistemology and examine contemporary responses to these questions. Topics will include: Can the concept of knowledge be analyzed, or should we think of knowledge as an unexplained explainer? Is truth an epistemic goal? Is it the only fundamental epistemic goal? Does knowledge require foundations? Are there epistemic virtues, and if so, do they play a role in explaining knowledge? Is there a priori knowledge? If so, how can we explain it?This seminar is intended for philosophy majors who have had at least two philosophy courses, and is limited to 15 students. In special cases, however, permission to take the course may be granted to non-majors.Admission to the seminar is by instructor approval. If you are interested in taking the seminar please email me at arpy@berkeley.edu, briefly indicating (1) if you are a philosophy major, (2) what philosophy courses you have taken, and (3) why you are interested in taking this seminar. You will be notified of your admission status by early December.As taught this semester, Phil 190 satisfies group A of the Epistemology/Metaphysics requirement.196 
Senior Seminar.
Kolodny.
M 12-2,
Barrows 186.
A collaborative writing workshop. Students in the honors program will develop their thesis, which they will have started to write in the fall in Philos H195. Other students will develop a paper from a previous course into a form suitable for a writing sample for applying to graduate school. Students will present drafts, followed by comments by an assigned respondent, and open discussion. As time permits, philosophical background for the work in progress may be read and discussed.Enrollment is by instructor approval. Students who are not in the honors program, but who are interested in enrolling should email Niko Kolodny (kolodny@berkeley.edu) with: (1) a list of courses taken or in progress in philosophy, together with grades received (or an unofficial transcript); and (2) a draft, outline, or description (as much as possible at this admittedly early stage) of the paper to be developed. Students who are in the honors program should email Kolodny for an enrollment code, but do not need to give any additional information about courses or thesis topic (which they already gave when they first enrolled in the honors program).198BC-1

We will look at some questions about the nature and source of our responsibilities with regard to future generations. How should we assess overall states of affairs when thinking about the well-being of the people who will exist in them? Can we arrive at a “population axiology” that is free from paradox or contradiction? Do we have a responsibility, as individuals, to bring about states of affairs that are better rather than worse in this dimension? Is our concern for future generations a concern for the individual humans who will come into existence, or for the population as a whole, or for the species that they belong to? Might our concern for future generations be grounded at least as much in our interest in the quality of our own lives as in morality? Does it matter, at all, whether the human species eventually becomes extinct?In thinking about these issues, we will discuss recent texts by Johann Frick, Hilary Greaves, Derek Parfit, Samuel Scheffler, and others.   290-5

Individual Morality & Social Justice.
Callard.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
185 Barrows.
In this course, we will read three philosophical works about the relationship between individual morality and social justice: Plato’s Republic, Hobbes’ Leviathan, and Rawls’ Theory of Justice.  We will ask: What is the purpose of society?  What makes a society a just one? What makes individuals just?  What can the “state of nature” tell us about how societies are or ought to be formed?  What aspects of the moral life of a human being are independent of his status as a citizen, and what ought to happen if there is a conflict between the two roles?12A 
Introduction to Logic.
Rao.
MTuW 12-2:30,
220 Wheeler Hall.
This course is an introduction to the concepts and
principles of deductive logic.  We will begin by
learning how to symbolize English language sentences
and arguments in a way that shows their logical
structure; we will next address, e.g., what it is for
a statement to be valid, for one or more statements to
imply another, or for two statements to be equivalent
(in both truth-functional and quantificational
contexts); we will end by learning a formal system of
deductive proof. Requirements: Lecture and section attendance, weekly
problem sets, a midterm, and a final.Text: Warren Goldfarb’s Deductive Logic, Hackett,

Ancient Philosophy.
Yurdin.
MTuWTh 12-2,
2320 Tolman.
This course is an introduction to the doctrines and arguments of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  We will consider topics in ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology, including human virtue and the good life, the relation between knowledge and virtue, the possibility of weakness of will, the nature of the soul, the relation between knowledge and
belief, the nature of forms and particulars, and the structure and character of scientific explanation.  This course serves both as an introduction to Ancient Philosophy and as an introduction to philosophy in general; the course does not presuppose any background in philosophy.132 
Philosophy of Mind.
Khatchirian.
WThF 10-12:30,
136 Barrows.
What does it take to be a bearer of mental properties? In this course, we will survey different philosophical accounts of the nature of the mind and of the relation between mental properties and physical properties. We will examine the extent to which we can think of being in a certain mental state (such as having a headache, seeing a color, or hoping to win a race) as a matter of being in a certain physical state, exhibiting a certain kind of behavior, or realizing a functional state.We will focus mostly, though not exclusively, on mental states that have content, such as beliefs, desires, hopes and experiences. To say that these states have content is to say that we can describe them by specifying what they are about. What does it take to have mental states that are about something or other? We will be particularly concerned with mental states that are about objects in one’s environment and their properties. Can one’s capacity for thought about the external world be explained in terms of more primitive sorts of mental states or more basic sorts of content? We will contrast two approaches to thought. The first takes the contents of one’s thoughts to be inner items of which one is immediately aware, while the second takes them to be constituted by one’s relations to objects and properties in the environment. We will examine the extent to which either of these opposing conceptions can give us a satisfying picture of the relation between our thoughts and the environment we live in. Throughout the course, we will pay special attention to a peculiar feature of mental states, or at least of our conception of mental states. This is the difference between the sort of knowledge each of us has of his or her own mental states and the sort of knowledge each of us has of the mental states of others. It is very tempting to think that any knowledge of other people’s mental states has to be derived from a more immediate awareness of one’s own mental states. If this is right, can one ever really gain knowledge of other people’s mental states?  If not, what is the relation between knowledge of one’s own mental states and knowledge of others’ mental states?The readings will include texts from Descartes, Ryle, Strawson, Putnam, Nagel, Davidson and Burge.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California3 
Nature of Mind.
Beattie.
MTuW 2-4:30,
229 Dwinelle.
This course will serve as an introduction to
philosophical thinking about the mind.  As with any
good introduction to philosophical thinking, it will
raise many more questions than it will answer.  These
questions will include the following:  What is the
mind?  What do we mean when we say someone is
thinking, or experiencing something?  Is our
conception of the mind compatible with a scientific
outlook?  Could a computer think?  Can animals?The course will draw primarily on short readings from
contemporary philosophers such as Nagel, Dennett,
Searle, Fodor, etc. 4 
Knowledge & Its Limits.
Marusic.
TuWTh 10-12:30,
229 Dwinelle.
This course will be concerned with the problem of philosophical skepticism. The course will begin and end with a reading of Descartes’s Meditations, and it will be built around the skeptical arguments of the First Meditation. We will study several responses to those arguments, and we will consider how those responses shape our understanding of what knowledge is. Finally, we will consider how Descartes himself understood the import of those skeptical arguments. Readings will be from Descartes, Stroud, Austin, Moore, Broughton, and others. We will also consider the role of skeptical scenarios in contemporary movies such as The Matrix, Fight Club, and The Truman Show.25A 
Ancient Philosophy.
Barnes.
MTuWTh 12-2,

Ancient Greek philosophy unearthed an enormous number of enduring philosophical problems.  In this class we will look at some of those problems in their original context, with an eye to understanding not only what the problems are, and why they arose, but also why many of them persist.  To the extent possible, the class will be a philosophy class with ancient textbooks, rather than a class on the history of philosophy.25B 
Modern Philosophy.
Smalligan.
MTuWTh 2-4,
20 Wheeler.
This course will provide an introduction to six of the major philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries. Particular focus will be on close, critical reading of philosophical texts, written in a variety of philosophical genres. Students will examine a number of metaphysical and epistemological problems, and lectures will seek to locate these problems within a broader historical context, particularly emphasizing the influence of the Scientific Revolution on the development of modern philosophy. Topics covered will include: the debate about innate ideas, arguments for the existence of God, the nature of material substance, the relation between mind and body, the distinction between primary and secondary qualities, causation, induction, skepticism and the use of skeptical arguments in philosophical reflection, the nature of space and time, and the possibility of metaphysics. The philosophers to be studied are Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, Leibniz, Hume, and Kant.104 
Ethical Theories.
Wallace.
MTuW 10-12:30,

This course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy. We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as some influential work by contemporary philosophers (including Korsgaard, Nagel, Scanlon, and Williams).

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and  first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal  notion of a valid argument.  Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from  the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we wil introduce a deductive system (a  natural deduction system), which explicate the intuive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational  rules in a calculus. This will be done in satges, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives  such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’ and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions  such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’. In addition, we will also develop techniques to show when  a claim does not follow from the premisses of an argument. This is done by developing the  semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the  propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic.    At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues,   such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus. Textbook: J. Barwise, J.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA course of close reading and detailed discussion of central parts of Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations (1953).  Other works by Wittgenstein and some interpretative commentary will be introduced occasionally, but the emphasis throughout will be on reading, understanding, and discussing this book.  The book embodies a conception of philosophy as a certain kind of intellectual activity, not simply defense of philosophical doctrines or theories, so the course is likely to be most interesting and of the greatest value to those students willing to respond in open discussion to the thoughts and lines of inquiry presented there.  Those responses themselves can serve as part of the “data” for philosophical investigation.  This requires active engagement in discussion in class and in weekly discussion-sections and in any other settings that present themselves to interested students.  The course is meant to be as much as possible an exercise in doing philosophy, not simply in studying or commenting on the philosophical views of others.Previously taught:

We’ll draw on this to look at the recent debate about the nature and viability of Bayesian models of perceptual processing. We will also cover some recent debates about the nature of perceptual experience, including the debate about “perceptual credences”: does perceptual experience assign probabilities or levels of confidence to hypotheses about  the environment? We will also discuss what bearing, if any, different models of perceptual processing have on the debate about the metaphysics of conscious perceptual states (e.g. is disjunctivism incompatible with the classical computational model?).The reading for the course will include chapters from Nico Orlandi’s recent book “The Innocent Eye: why Vision is not a Cognitive Process”.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

In addition, Frege was a platonist and held that our knowledge of arithmetic is about a special domain of mind-independent, non-spatiotemporal objects  – the natural numbers – and their characteristic properties and relations. Frege thought he could establish the a priori nature of arithmetic and platonism about its subject matter through his logicism, namely the claim that arithmetic is definitionally reducible to logic. This led him to also claim that numbers are logical objects (extensions of concepts).In the first part of the seminar, we will look at the philosophical underpinnings and technical elaboration of Frege’s logicism.  We will see how Frege motivated his logicism against rival empiricist, formalist, and Kantian views of arithmetic, and how he took his logicism to answer the philosophical problems raised by platonism.  We will look at some of the details of his technical theory. And we will see how Russell showed Frege’s theory of extensions to be inconsistent, causing Frege to abandon the project.The second part of the seminar is devoted to an attempt to revive Frege’s project that goes under the name of Neo-logicism or, now more commonly, Neo-Fregeanism or Abstractionism. A mathematical result established by Wright and foreshadowed by Frege, known as Frege’s theorem, shows how little the technical development of Frege’s logicism actually depends on the theory of extensions shown inconsistent by Russell. There has been much debate about the significance of this work.  Wright and Hale, who espouse a neologicist position, have argued that it shows that Frege’s logicist program can be salvaged, with slight modifications, into a philosophically satisfying account of arithmetic.  Boolos, Heck, Dummett, and others have argued the contrary position. The discussion has been raging since the publication of Wright’s book “Frege’s conception of numbers as objects” (1983) and it is still the focus of great interest in much contemporary philosophy of mathematics. In addition to study some classic sources (including Wright’s 1983 book), we will also discuss several very recent contributions to Neo-logicism.Prerequisites:   The seminar is open to all graduate students in Philosophy and Logic and Methodology of Science.  Interested undergraduates, visiting students, etc. should seek the permission of the instructor before enrolling.  I will presuppose that everyone has had a good introductory course in first-order logic, at the level of Philosophy 12A.  Previous coursework in logical metatheory, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of language, Kant, and Frege may be helpful but are not required.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA collaborative writing workshop. Students in the honors program will develop their thesis, which they will have started to write in the fall in Philos H195. Other students will develop a paper from a previous course into a form suitable for a writing sample for applying to graduate school. Students will present drafts, followed by comments by an assigned respondent, and open discussion. As time permits, philosophical background for the work in progress may be read and discussed.Enrollment is by instructor approval.  Students who are not in the honors program, but who are interested in enrolling should email Niko Kolodny (kolodny@berkeley.edu) with: (1) a list of courses taken or in progress in philosophy, together with grades received (or an unofficial transcript); and (2) a draft, outline, or description (as much as possible at this admittedly early stage) of the paper to be developed.  Students who are in the honors program should email Kolodny for an enrollment code, but do not need to give any additional information about courses or thesis topic (which they already gave when they first enrolled in the honors program).Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is designed as a workshop for the presentation and discussion of work-in-progress in moral, political, and legal theory. The central aim of the course is to provide an opportunity for students to engage directly with philosophers, political theorists, and legal scholars working on normative questions. Another aim is to create a space that brings together people from different disciplines who have strong normative interests or who speak to issues philosophers and theorists should know something about.  Toward this goal, we will devote a few sessions to featuring the work of economists, sociologists, and even a biologist (to talk about the ethics of genetic editing).  
    The format of the course will be as follows.  For the sessions with guest presenters, lunch will be served starting at 12:00.  We’ll begin at 12:15.  A designated commentator will lead off with a 15-minute comment on the presenter’s paper.  The presenter will have 5-10 minutes to respond and then we will open up the discussion to the entire assembled group.  The first part of the course will be open to non-enrolled students and faculty who wish to participate in the workshop discussion. We’ll stop for a break at 1:45 and those not enrolled in the course will leave. Enrolled students will continue the discussion with the guest presenter from 2:00 to 3:00. 
    This is a room-shared course. Students may enroll through the Law School or the Philosophy or Political Science Departments.  Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course aims to provide a “graduate level introduction” to contemporary moral philosophy.  That is, it is intended to supply students with little or no prior philosophical background with a working knowledge of major themes and debates in moral philosophy.  It takes its organizing theme the topic of claims of moral, political, and legal rights, and looks to how deontological (Kantian) and consequentialist (Mill’s utilitarianism) theories can support or limit those claims.  In this part of the seminar, we will move back and forth between concrete examples of rights (for example, rights against torture, and rights to free speech), and more abstract treatments in both the classical and contemporary canonical literature. We will also take up questions of moral knowledge and the relevance of perspective (including gendered perspectives).Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe seminar will work through Plato’s unjustly neglected dialogue, the Euthydemus, examining its analysis of sophistry and the relation (or the failure of relations) between the sophistic arguments and the Socratic discussion of virtue and knowledge. We shall consider the connections between the Euthydemus and other Platonic dialogues (notably Meno, Republic and Theaetetus) and reflect on Aristotle’s account of the sophistic arguments in his Sophistical Refutations.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaQuestions of individual morality and social justice are questions not about how things are, but about how they ought to be. We will study some of these questions, and traditional attempts to answer them. In addition to studying philosophy, we will also do philosophy. That is — while being informed by the answers and arguments given by Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Bentham, Mill, Nietzsche, and others — we will attempt to state and defend our own answers to these questions.  Here are some examples of the questions will will discuss: What is the morally right thing to do?  Why should I do the morally right thing?  Is there a moral law that applies to everyone, or is it relative in some way?  Why, if at all, should I obey the law? Why, if at all, should I tolerate beliefs and practices other than my own? There are no prerequisites for taking this course.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat is it like to be a roomba, humming across the floor? Nothing. Of course, the little vacuum cleaner detects things—walls, for example. And it reacts accordingly—by turning, for example. This is, to be sure, a cute dance. But there is nothing it is like to be the dancer. The roomba doesn’t, for example, feel itself bump against the wall, or see itself turn away from it. (Go ahead and try to put yourself in the roomba’s shoes—try to imagine what it is like to be the roomba. There is nothing there to be imagined.)
What is it like to be you? Here there is more to say. Of course, like the roomba, you detect things and react accordingly. But, unlike the roomba, you also experience what’s around—you see, hear, taste, smell, and touch. What’s more, you have a rich inner life, full of thoughts, moods, and bodily sensations. You are, in short, conscious. The roomba is not.
This difference between conscious and unconscious things seems deep and important. But how does it arise? What exactly is it about you that makes you conscious? And what’s missing in unconscious things, like the roomba?
In this course, you will grapple with these and related questions about consciousness, and learn about philosophical (and some scientific) attempts to answer them. Along the way, you will learn how to read and write philosophy. This is an introductory course, with no prerequisites.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will survey the beginnings of philosophy in the Western tradition with special attention to Socrates (469-399), Plato (427-347), Aristotle (384-322), and the Epicurean, Stoic, and Skeptical schools that flourished in the subsequent centuries. In particular, we will discuss their approaches to scientific knowledge, the structure of the world, and the good human life. Since the ancient Greeks identified many of the philosophical problems (and models for their resolution) we are still concerned with today, the course also serves as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?
These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat distinguishes meaningful sounds and marks from meaningless ones? Are the meanings of our words to be explained in terms of the intentions with which we use them? Or are meanings determined in some other way? In what ways, if any, do the meanings of our words depend on features of our environment? Is the meaning of a word a thing in the world for which it can be said to stand? What is the relation between the meaning of a word and the meanings of sentences in which it occurs? What role, if any, should the notion of truth play in explaining what it is for our sentences to mean what they do?
All of these questions presuppose that there are facts of the matter about what our words mean, or at least a difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises. But we will also examine arguments questioning these assumptions. Are there any determinate facts of the matter about what our words mean? If not, is there, after all, any real difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises? Readings will include work by Frege, Grice, Putnam, Burge, Quine, Kripke, Davidson, Searle, Strawson, Lewis, and others.Previously taught:

This includes an in-depth study of the Meditations, focusing on both Descartes’ epistemological project and his anti-scholastic metaphysics supplemented by readings from the Objections and Replies, the Principles, and several important pieces of secondary literature. Issues discussed include the method of doubt, the Cartesian circle, Descartes’ mode of presentation in the Meditations, the creation and ontological status of the eternal truths, the status of the human being, the nature of substance, mind-body dualism and Descartes’ physics as presented in the Principles.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will address the basic questions of ethics. How should we live? What is a good human being like, and what kind of life so they lead? We’ll address these big questions by focusing on some slightly smaller ones: by what standard are some actions right and other wrong? Is a moral life (necessarily) a free and authentic one? Or does morality present some kind of threat to our freedom or authenticity? To what extent is living an ethical life under our control? What kinds of emotions and desires do ethical people have, and what role do they play in their lives? Throughout the class, we will connect our discussion of these general questions to contemporary ethical issues concerning race and gender. Our readings will be drawn from a wide variety of philosophical traditions: among others, we will read Simon de Beauvoir, John Stuart Mill, Iris Murdoch, Aristotle, Marth Nussbaum, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Confucius.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to the tools of formal logic, with the goal of using them to evaluate arguments. We will cover the syntax and semantics of sentential and first-order logic, and develop proof systems for both. This will give us the tools to symbolize natural language arguments in both formal languages, assess arguments for validity, and give deductive proofs. Overall, we will be developing resources to think precisely about what makes for good and bad reasoning, in both everyday and philosophical contexts.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. It provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek philosophical thinking from its pre-Socratic beginnings through the works of Aristotle. The course will be divided in to four sections: We will read, discuss, and write about the views of [1] an important group of pre-Socratic thinkers, [2] Socrates (469 – 399 BC), [3] Plato (427-347 BC), and [4] Aristotle (384-322 BC) on a wide variety of topics including: the nature of the universe, how to investigate reality, the nature of knowledge, the structure of the soul, the nature of virtue, and what is required to lead a good life. Since these issues are foundational for the Western philosophical tradition, the course may also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally. This course is required for the philosophy major, but has no prerequisites, and no prior philosophical experience will be presupposed.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will explore topics in the philosophy of art. What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century). Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat is reality like in itself, considered independently from our thought or experience of it? Questions of this sort arise for specific domains. For instance: does mind-independent reality fix the truths of morality? Or is morality really some sort of projection of our attitudes, or some kind of human invention? Do things have colors independently of us, or do we “gild or stain all natural objects with the colours, borrowed from internal sentiment”, as Hume put it? Is causation a real thing, or does it merely seem to be, owing to the way we happen to apprehend the world? Do things have necessary or essential properties independently of our modes of thinking and talking about them? What even are properties — how do they fit into reality? And what about familiar entities of everyday life, like persons and material objects — can we arrive at a conception of their nature entirely in abstraction from our ways of thinking and perceiving such things? Metaphysics is characterized by a special preoccupation with questions like these — and with the meta-question of whether such questions can even be answered. Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will focus on early Chinese philosophical thought, including different schools such as Confucianism, Daoism, Moism and Yangism. Thinkers to be considered include Confucius, Mozi (Mo Tzu), Yangzhu (Yang Chu), Mencius, Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu) and Xunzi (Hsun Tzu). We will discuss the connotations of key philosophical terms, analyze important passages, and consider the relation between and the influence among different early Chinese thinkers. While attending closely to the primary texts, the emphasis is on philosophical ideas in these texts, and we will explore some of these ideas in relation to the contemporary philosophical literature. The overall goal of the course is to provide an understanding of Chinese traditions of thought in their proper historical and cultural contexts, and to illustrate a way of doing philosophical work with these traditions that does justice to their distinctive characteristics and insights.Previously taught:

We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as influential work by important contemporary philosophers (including Foot, Korsgaard, Scanlon, and Williams). Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)? Why should we care about complying with moral demands? What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)? Is there anything interesting that we can say, in general terms, about what makes actions morally right or wrong?Previously taught:

Some topics to be discussed: (1) what constitutes art – from paradigm to anything goes? (2) art in its essential tension “between Avantgarde and Kitsch”; (3) art as criticism of “reality” and “understanding”; (4) art and history: truth-happening or emancipatory practice; (5) how does art “speak”? or art in language and art as language.Course Requirements:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course explores philosophical questions of race, ethnicity, and citizenship, with special attention to the experiences of African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, and indigenous peoples of the United States.  Topics include the meaning of “race,” “ethnicity,” and “citizenship,” border control and immigration, reparations for past wrongs, discrimination and affirmative action, civic obligation and group solidarity, and the right to vote.We define ourselves, or are defined by others, as members of social groups: for example, as a U.S. citizen, as Latina, as African American, as Yurok, as sansei, and so on.  Needless to say, our real or perceived membership in these groups affects what we can expect of others and what they expect of us.•       If you are a U.S. citizen, then you may stay within the U.S. as long as you like, you may vote in a variety of elections, but you will be required to pay tax on foreign income.  The same will go for your children.  If you are not a U.S. citizen, then you may be deported for a crime, you may not vote in most elections, but you will not be required to pay tax on foreign income.  The same will go for your children, unless you happen to give birth to them in a U.S. hospital.•       If you were of Japanese descent, living on the West Coast during the Second World War, then you were most likely confined in an internment camp.  If you survived until 1988, then you were sent an apology and $20,000 from the federal government.•       In Plessy v. Ferguson, the US Supreme Court decided, roughly, that the State of Louisiana could count the fact that you had an ancestor who would today be described as “African American” as a (decisive) reason to keep you from sitting in certain railway cars.  In Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the US Supreme Court permitted, roughly, the State of California to count the fact that you were African American as a (partial) reason to admit you to medical school.•       If you are Latino/a, living in certain neighborhoods, then you may find other Latinos/as offering to drive you to the polls on Election Day, when they wouldn’t if you were Anglo, living in another neighborhood.  If, on the way, they find out that you can’t speak Spanish, or you support Donald Trump, they may ask you to explain yourself, in a way they wouldn’t if you were Anglo, living in another neighborhood.This course is not about the fact, important though it is, that our real or perceived membership in such groups affects what others do to us and what they expect us to do for them.  Instead, this course asks when and why, if ever, our real or perceived group membership ought morally to affect what others do to us and what they expect us to do for them.We will begin discussion of each topic with stage-setting readings, drawn from law and history, to help us to understand the real-world, and distinctively American, contexts in which these moral questions have arisen.  However, we will approach these topics not as lawyers or historians, but instead as moral philosophers.  The focus will be on making precise, deciding among, and ultimately justifying the underlying values and principles that might answer these moral questions.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will survey a range of philosophical topics relating to modern science. Topic 1: Science and Religion. Is there a scientific explanation of our existence? Does the “Fine Tuning” of the laws of physics imply that the universe was designed by a creator to support life? Topic 2: Science and Society. What is the role of science in a democracy? What obligations do scientists have to citizens, and citizens to scientists? Topic 3: The Philosophy of Computer Science. Elon Musk recently said that we probably live in a computer simulation—is he right? What is the “singularity” and how should we prepare for it? What is the ethical status of an artificial intelligence? Topic 4: The Metaphysics of Science. Does science discover a read-made world that exists “out there”, independently of us? When biologists sort organisms into species, are they carving the world “at its natural joints” or do their categories more reflect their own way of thinking? Topic 5: The Epistemology of Science. Scientists typically extrapolate from data, making predictions about the future that have not yet been observed. Is there any non-circular argument that their predictions will be reliable? If not, does this mean that science is ultimately based on faith? The course is designed for students across the university; no prior knowledge of philosophy or science is required.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course deals with fundamental ethical issues and is intended, at the same time, as an introduction to philosophy. It seeks to addresses questions concerning the self, our relations to others and our commitment to various human communities. It asks, thus: How can I lead a good life? Are there rules for my relations with others? How are we to settle questions of social living together?We will examine these issues with the help of writings from both Western and Non-Western sources, both classical and modern authors. All the required readings will be made available in a Class Reader.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy–and, for the uninitiated, to philosophy itself. We will spend almost all of our time on the three most important Greek philosophers–Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle–with a passing glance at pre-Socratic and Hellenistic philosophers. Our primary goal will be to
understand these philosophers’ characteristic methods and views, and (more importantly) their reasons for holding these views. It is often said that we should study ancient Greek philosophy because it is the intellectual basis for all later western philosophy and natural science. That is true, but it is only half the story. We should also study ancient Greek philosophy to become familiar with a worldview so alien that it throws our own into sharp relief. As you are outraged by some of the things these philosophers say, you will come to see more clearly what your own views are, and you will be forced to ask what justifies them. You will not just be studying the history of philosophy; you will be doing philosophy. Prerequisite: None.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is a close examination of the structure of Spinoza’s philosophical system. Most of our time will be spent on a careful reading of Spinoza’s Ethics Demonstrated in Geometric Order, in which Spinoza argues for a comprehensive philosophical system that encompasses metaphysics, epistemology, psychology and ethics. Our primary goal will be to come to a deep understanding of Spinoza’s philosophical views, the relation of these views to those of his contemporaries, and the relevance of his views to contemporary philosophical theories. Our reading of the Ethics will be informed by important pieces of correspondence between Spinoza and his contemporaries.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will be organized around a close examination of the contractualist position developed by T.M. Scanlon in What We Owe to Each Other.  We will consider the relation between Scanlon’s contractualism and Rawls’s use of contractarian ideas, and we will discuss a number of critical responses to Scanlon.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe topic of this seminar is Aristotle’s Peri ideôn or On Ideas, his lost treatise on Platonic Forms. In this treatise Aristotle described and then criticized a series of Platonic arguments for the existence of Forms. (One of Aristotle’s criticisms was the famous “Third Man” objection.) Our knowledge of the Peri ideôn is largely dependent on Alexander’s commentary on the first book of the Metaphysics. We will be reading the relevant part of Alexander’s commentary alongside related passages in Aristotle and in Plato.Required text: Gail Fine, On Ideas (Oxford)Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will attempt to get to grips with the “rule-following considerations” presented in Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations and in other texts. These considerations raise questions about what it is to follow a rule and to grasp the meaning of an expression. They have been taken by some commentators, including Kripke, to present a skeptical argument undermining the very possibility of rule-following and of meaning.Our primary focus will be the passages which are typically taken as central to the rule-following considerations (Investigations §§185-242), but we will look at these in the context of material from earlier in the Investigations and of other work of Wittgenstein, in particular Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics. Depending on time and the interest of the participants we will also read some of the relevant secondary literature, including work by Dummett, Stroud, Wright, McDowell, Ebbs, Goldfarb and KripkeHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will be devoted to a close reading of writings by John Dewey and Maurice Merleau-Ponty on the topic of art. Both thinkers frame their understanding of art against the background of accounts of experience and the natural world. Dewey and Merleau-Ponty held that it is only possible to understand art and its place in human life if you have an adequate conception of experience and nature. In addition, they seem to have believed that art itself may be a medium for arriving at that adequate conception. The texts for this course will include:  Art As Experience, by John Dewey (Penguin/Perigree, 1934); The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader: Philosophy and Painting, (edited by Galen A. Johnson Northwestern University Press, 1993); Sense and Non-sense, by Maurice Merleau-Ponty, (edited by Hubert Dreyfus and Patricia Allen Dreyfus. Northwestern University Press, 1964). In addition, we will read selections from The Phenomenology of Perception, by Maurice Merleau-Ponty (Translated by Donald A Landes, Routledge, 2012), as well as writings by other authors.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPresentations by graduate students of dissertation research in progress.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will take up central problems concerning the nature of mind and examine contemporary approaches to these problems. We will ask the following questions: Can science explain consciousness? If not, can we still make sense of consciousness as part of the natural world? Can we make sense of thought as part of the natural world? What are we doing when we attribute thoughts to ourselves and to others? Are beliefs and desires real? Are they genuine causes of behavior? What role, if any, does our environment play in fixing the contents of our thoughts? And where is the mind anyway? Is it located where our brain or body is located, or does it extend beyond our body?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaCross-listed as LAW 210.2A-001 and POLSCI 211-001.This course is a workshop for discussing work-in-progress in moral, political, and legal theory. The central aim is to enable students to engage directly with philosophers, political theorists, and legal scholars working on normative questions. Another aim is to create a space that brings together people from different disciplines and perspectives — including economists, sociologists, and political scientists as well as journalists — who have strong normative interests or who speak to issues philosophers and theorists should know something about. In Fall 2017, the workshop will focus on “borders, citizenship, and immigration.” A list of confirmed presenters is below.The format of the course will be as follows. For the sessions with guest presenters, lunch will be served starting at 12:00. We’ll begin at 12:15. A designated commentator will lead off with a 15-minute comment on the presenter’s paper. The presenter will have 5-10 minutes to respond and then we will open up the discussion to the group. The first part of the course will be open to non-enrolled students and faculty who wish to participate in the workshop discussion. We’ll stop for a break at 1:45 and those not enrolled in the course will leave. Enrolled students will continue the discussion with the guest presenter from 2:00 to 3:00.This is a room-shared course. Students may enroll through the Law School (Law 210.2), Philosophy Department (Philosophy 290), or the Political Science Department (PS 211). The first class will meet on Friday, August 25.Schedule:

Bradley, and Schaffer.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will examine a range of psychological phenomena related to the ethical and spiritual life of humans, drawing on both contemporary philosophical approaches and Confucian thought. Topics to be covered include: pride, modesty and humility; anger, resentment and forgiveness; compassion, empathy and sympathy; death and acceptance; purity, detachment and tranquility; as well as other selected topics. The unifying theme underlying the exploration of these topics is the idea of ‘no self’, that is, the idea that ethical self-transformation involves a move away from different forms of undue focus on the self.This class is restricted to Philosophy majors during Phase I enrollment.Previously taught:

Topics may include: (1) What does physics teach us about the structure of space? (2) Is there a scientific explanation of the flow of time? (3) Are quantum mechanical chances objective or just measures of subjective uncertainty? (4) What about chances in high-level sciences like biology and economics? Along the way, we’ll use these discussions as gateways into more general issues in the philosophy of science such as realism vs anti-realism, the nature of scientific laws, and the demarcation problem. By the end, we’ll have worked our way towards a certain picture of how the different sciences hang together as a unified whole.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein. We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege and Russell.Please note that lectures and discussions will assume that everyone present has completed one course in logic (in this the 135 course is different to the 135 course given in previous years).This class is restricted to Philosophy majors during Phase I enrollment.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this seminar, we will address some central questions in epistemology and examine contemporary responses to these questions. Topics will include: Can the concept of knowledge be analyzed, or should we think of knowledge as an unexplained explainer? Is truth an epistemic goal? Is it the only fundamental epistemic goal? Does knowledge require foundations? Are there epistemic virtues, and if so, do they play a role in explaining knowledge? Is there a priori knowledge? If so, how can we explain it?This seminar is intended for philosophy majors who have had at least two philosophy courses, and is limited to 15 students. In special cases, however, permission to take the course may be granted to non-majors.Admission to the seminar is by instructor approval.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSince its publication in 1927, Heidegger’s major work Being and Time has been many things to its various recipients. Although the work became enormously important for the development of phenomenology,  hermeneutics, existential thought, and post-structuralism, its main concern was a revolution in what Heidegger regarded as the central concept of philosophy since antiquity: that of being. Because he viewed the traditional understanding of this concept as superficial and misguided, his plan was (in part) to work out a new fundamental ontology. Its design was (I) to reveal the proper meaning of being on the basis of temporality as its transcendental horizon and (II) to point out the crucial missteps in the tradition (Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant) that led to the deeply problematic contemporary conception of being. Heidegger never finished this ambitious project, but the work’s first part—with its extensive analysis of human understanding as the basis of the conception of being—was sufficient to make Being and Time an essential text for friend and foe alike. The course will be devoted to a close study of this challenging, influential, and fascinating work. We will focus on the connection between the question of being, the analysis of human nature, and the phenomenological method that Heidegger presents as the necessary foundation of his project in Division I of Being and Time. We will also cover his analysis of death, conscience, resoluteness, and Dasein’s authentic potentiality for being ‘whole’, i.e. the first three chapters of Division II.Main text: Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, translated by John Macquarrie/Edward Robinson, paperback reprint (Harper Perennial Modern Thought Series, 2008).

We will try to get to the bottom of several contemporary debates about conditionals.  These debates will involve semantical, metaphysical, epistemological, logical, and pragmatic aspects of conditionals of various kinds (including indicative and subjunctive conditionals).  The course will be pretty self-contained, and it will not presuppose too much technical or philosophical background.  Our main goal will be to complete a careful reading of (most of) Jonathan Bennett’s recent book “A Philosophical Guide to Conditionals” (an excellent survey of the contemporary literature on conditionals).  We will also read some of the primary sources that Bennett discusses (these additional readings will all be made available on the seminar webpage).Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is the official course listing for the Workshop in Law, Philosophy, and Political Theory of the Kadish Center for Morality, Law, and Public Affairs.

How should we assess overall states of affairs when thinking about the well-being of the people who will exist in them? Can we arrive at a “population axiology” that is free from paradox or contradiction? Do we have a responsibility, as individuals, to bring about states of affairs that are better rather than worse in this dimension? Is our concern for future generations a concern for the individual humans who will come into existence, or for the population as a whole, or for the species that they belong to? Might our concern for future generations be grounded at least as much in our interest in the quality of our own lives as in morality? Does it matter, at all, whether the human species eventually becomes extinct?In thinking about these issues, we will discuss recent texts by Johann Frick, Hilary Greaves, Derek Parfit, Samuel Scheffler, and others.

The course will be organized around various attempts to describe the self while rejecting the idea of a human nature, and attempts to reinterpret the Judeo/Christian God, and to determine in what sense, if at all, such a God is still a living God.  We will study Dostoyevsky’s and Kierkegaard’s attempts to preserve a non-theological version of the God of Christianity, as well as Nietzsche’s attempt to free us from belief in any version of God offered by our tradition.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will be taught in seminar format, with one weekly three-hour meeting and enrollment limited to fifteen students.  The topic of the seminar will be global justice.  Are there principles of justice that apply to the world as a whole?  If there are no such principles, then who, if anyone, is responsible for the alleviation of global poverty?  What becomes of the idea of human rights?  And is there anything wrong with economic inequality between rich and poor nations?  If, on the other hand, there are principles of global justice, then do they supplement or instead take the place of principles that apply to a single society?  Are we ever justified in giving the interests of our compatriots priority over the interests of other people?  In the absence of a world government, who might be responsible for implementing global principles?  The course is intended for juniors and seniors with substantial background in philosophy.  Philosophy 115 or the equivalent is a prerequisite, and the course will presuppose familiarity with Rawls’ A Theory of Justice and Political Liberalism.  Course readings will be drawn from four books: Charles Beitz, Political Theory and International Relations, Thomas Pogge, World Poverty and Human Rights, John Rawls, The Law of Peoples, and Peter Singer, One World.  Students will be required to give one or more class presentations, to complete a short written assignment (1-2 pages) each week, and to write a final term paper of 12-15 pages.  Active participation in class discussion is also a requirement.Enrollment in the course is by consent of the instructor only.  Students who are interested in enrolling should contact Professor Scheffler by e-mail before 5 p.m. on Monday, December 1.  E-mails should be addressed to schefflr@socrates.berkeley.edu and should include “Philosophy 116 application” in the subject line.  Those who contact Professor Scheffler before the deadline will receive an application form with more detailed instructions.  Students will be informed by mid-December whether they are admitted to the course.  Students who are admitted to the course and who attend the first class meeting will receive a class entry code and will be able to enroll through TELEBEARS during the first week of classes.  Please note that since admission to the course is not guaranteed, students who need a philosophy course to graduate in Spring 2004 should have a backup plan for meeting that need.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe philosophy of perception is a microcosm of the metaphysics of mind.  Its central problems – What is perception?  What is the nature of perceptual consciousness?  How can one fit an account of perceptual experience into a broader account of the nature of the mind and the world? – are problems at the heart of metaphysics.  It is often justifiably said that the theory of perception (and especially vision) is the area of psychology and neuroscience that has made the greatest progress in recent years. Despite this progress, or perhaps because of it, philosophical problems about perception retain a great urgency, both for philosophy and for science.Course readings:  Vision and Mind:  Selected Readings in the Philosophy of Perception, by Alva Noe and Evan Thompson (MIT Press), 2002.

It is divided into four parts. The first three parts are mathematical in style whereas the last part is philosophical. In the first part we will cover the basic notions of computability theory and study in detail the Turing’s machine approach to computability. We will then move on to the basic metatheoretical results about first order logic (completeness, undecidability, compactness, Löwenheim-Skolem).

Readers unacquainted with virtue ethics or ancient philosophy have to accustom themselves to a different mode of thought in Aristotle which challenges much in modern analytical philosophy, but when we read him on how we should live, on the role of the emotions in our moral life, on the individual virtues and vices, on friendship, on moral education, and on the primacy of the practical over the theoretical in ethics, we find his work, despite its antiquity, as relevant to contemporary thought as one could wish.

What results is an original interpretation of being-in-the-world that describes skill in a way that undermines the subject/object distinction, and, in so doing, offers a convincing account of the nature and limitations of philosophical and scientific theory.  This account has important implications for all those disciplines that study human beings.Required text:  Heidegger, M, Being and Time, trans Macquarrie & Robinson (Harper and Row)Recommended texts:

Our goal is twofold. The first is to investigate psychoanalytic theory itself, as developed by Freud, amended by some of his significant philosophers, and supplemented contemporary neuroscience. The second is to enable students in philosophy, literature, psychology, and history to use the psychoanalytic perspective in their own disciplines; our critical eye will be particularly on the questions Freud raises in the philosophy of mind, and the implications of his theory for such philosophy. While the course will roughly follow the progression of Freud’s thought, its focus is not primarily historical but thematic.Required texts:

The aim of the seminar is to provide an overview of some of the topics that have attracted the attention of contemporary moral philosophers, through close reading of texts that have helped to set the agenda for those discussions. The seminar would be appropriate both for those who have not yet done much work in value theory, and for those with more specialized interests in this part of the subject (to whom some of the readings may already be familiar). Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThere is a recent growth of philosophical interest in the ontology of the social.  Some of the questions in this field are:  What is a social fact?   What are the relations between individual and collective intentionality?  What are human institutions?  How does human society differ from other primate societies?  What is the role of language in constituting human society?  How do power relations enter into social relations generally?  What sorts of facts can be “socially constructed” and what sorts cannot?In this seminar we will discuss works by Habermas, Gilbert, Tuomela, Searle and others.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe seminar is devoted to a detailed reading of Tarski’s seminal works on definability, truth, logical consequence, and logical constants.

We will study (inter alia) deductive-nomological, inductive-statistical, causal, counterfactual, and pragmatic approaches to scientific explanation.  In the second half (approximately) of the course, we will investigate the relationship between scientific explanation and scientific realism. Various arguments for scientific realism trade on various kinds of appeals to scientific explanation.  We will look at several of these arguments, and some replies from empiricists and other non-realists about science.  Time permitting: we will look at some alternative, non-realist (e.g., empiricist and instrumentalist) views of scientific progress and its relation to scientific explanation (as opposed to, e.g., prediction).Required Texts (two of them):

The course will be structured around a discussion of objectivity, disagreement, and pluralism in the domain of value. We will begin by addressing arguments for and against the objectivity of moral judgments, and consider their implications for the interpretation of moral discourse and moral practice. Next we will take up a range of concrete moral issues (involving war, killing, sex, and our obligations to those in need), and consider the distinctive normative issues they raise. We will then look at the requirements of living a meaningful human life, and explore their relations to morality. In the final sections of the course we will turn to issues of social and political theory, looking at the nature of a just society and at the problems of pluralism and toleration.
Texts will be taken primarily from contemporary sources, and will be collected in a course reader.      Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe philosophy of science, including also the philosophies of the special sciences (physics, biology etc.), plays a crucial role at the interface between science and philosophy (or at least it ought to!): it feeds both into science by analyzing its conceptual
foundations, and into large branches of philosophy by testing their practical applications. The course will both examine general issues and concrete examples from the philosophy of physics (no special background is required).Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument.  Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we wil introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicate the intuive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in satges, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’ and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’. In addition, we will also develop techniques to show when a claim does not follow from the premisses of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic.
    At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues,  such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn introduction to ancient philosophy primarily through major works of Plato and Aristotle. Plato and Aristotle set the agenda for many of the questions still thought fundamental to philosophic inquiry, but approached them in a spirit different from that typical of modern philosophy. They thought of philosophy as a way of life; indeed, the best way. The main topics to be covered are ethical virtue and its relation to happiness, the soul and its relation to the body, and the objects and nature of knowledge.  We will also consider the writing of Plato and Aristotle in the light of early Greek philosophers before Plato, as well as later developments by Epicureans, Stoics and Skeptics.
Readings from Plato will include Apology, Crito, Euthyphro, Protagoras Meno, Phaedo, and Republic; those from Aristotle will include selections from Categories, Posterior Analytics, Physics, Parts of Animals, Metaphysics, De Anima, Politics and Nicomachean Ethics.
Requirements: two four-page papers; final exam. All readings will be taken from:
(1) Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy: From Thales to Aristotle (2nd edition), edited by S. Marc Cohen, P. Curd and C.D.C. Reeve.
(2) Hellenistic Philosophy: Introductory Readings (2nd edition), edited and translated by Brad Inwood and Lloyd P. GersonHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course aims to help students improve their philosophical reading and writing. Students will write or revise papers weekly, and they will meet weekly with their GSIs to discuss their work.  The instructor will hold two one-hour class meetings each week to discuss the philosophical issues (of personal identity) about which the students will be writing, and to offer general advice about reading and writing philosophy.  Readings will be drawn from the works of  Locke, Reid, Hume, and three or four contemporary philosophers.  The course is required of philosophy majors, and enrollment is restricted to students who have declared the major.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA systematic examination of freedom and responsibility. The following topics will be addressed (among others): the relations between freedom of will, freedom of action, and autonomy; moral responsibility and its conditions; naturalism, determinism, and their relevance for human freedom; practical deliberation and the structure of the will; weakness and strength of will. Readings may be drawn from both historical and contemporary sources. The goal of the course is to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to historical and contemporary philosophical debates about the issues of freedom and responsibility.

raises about causal inference, causal necessity, and our ideas of material
objects, the self, and God.  We will also address more general questions,
including these:  What are the explanatory goals and methods of a
“scientist of man”?  What lines of thought lead Hume to skeptical
conclusions?  How are Hume’s naturalism and skepticism related to one

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will explore questions about Hume’s “naturalism” in several senses of that flexible term.  These may include his anti-supernaturalism, his attitudes toward the assumption that sense perception acquaints us with bodies, the limits of his readiness to question the practice of causal inference, the explanatory character of a “science of man,” and the nature of his endorsement of inquiries into human nature.  Our main text will be Book One of the Treatise.  We will also read articles and book-chapters by Edward Craig, Louis Loeb, Don Garrett, P. F. Strawson, and others.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will begin by spending two weeks  reading the “Monadology,” which gives an overview of Leibniz’s philosophical system.  The rest of the seminar will focus on the New Essays on Human Understanding, a work in which Leibniz presents his philosophical views on the philosophy of mind, epistemology, and metaphysics, in a detailed response to Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding.  We will be especially interested in considering the significance of this work for the conflict between empiricism and rationalism, and for the development of Kant’s thought.Required Texts:

We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics.  We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century.  But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right.  The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.Previously taught:

We will ask: What is the purpose of society?  What makes a society a just one? What makes individuals just?  What can the “state of nature” tell us about how societies are or ought to be formed?  What aspects of the moral life of a human being are independent of his status as a citizen, and what ought to happen if there is a conflict between the two roles?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat does it take to be a bearer of mental properties? In this course, we will survey different philosophical accounts of the nature of the mind and of the relation between mental properties and physical properties. We will examine the extent to which we can think of being in a certain mental state (such as having a headache, seeing a color, or hoping to win a race) as a matter of being in a certain physical state, exhibiting a certain kind of behavior, or realizing a functional state.We will focus mostly, though not exclusively, on mental states that have content, such as beliefs, desires, hopes and experiences. To say that these states have content is to say that we can describe them by specifying what they are about. What does it take to have mental states that are about something or other? We will be particularly concerned with mental states that are about objects in one’s environment and their properties. Can one’s capacity for thought about the external world be explained in terms of more primitive sorts of mental states or more basic sorts of content? We will contrast two approaches to thought. The first takes the contents of one’s thoughts to be inner items of which one is immediately aware, while the second takes them to be constituted by one’s relations to objects and properties in the environment. We will examine the extent to which either of these opposing conceptions can give us a satisfying picture of the relation between our thoughts and the environment we live in. Throughout the course, we will pay special attention to a peculiar feature of mental states, or at least of our conception of mental states. This is the difference between the sort of knowledge each of us has of his or her own mental states and the sort of knowledge each of us has of the mental states of others. It is very tempting to think that any knowledge of other people’s mental states has to be derived from a more immediate awareness of one’s own mental states. If this is right, can one ever really gain knowledge of other people’s mental states?  If not, what is the relation between knowledge of one’s own mental states and knowledge of others’ mental states?The readings will include texts from Descartes, Ryle, Strawson, Putnam, Nagel, Davidson and Burge.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will serve as an introduction to
philosophical thinking about the mind.  As with any
good introduction to philosophical thinking, it will
raise many more questions than it will answer.  These
questions will include the following:  What is the
mind?  What do we mean when we say someone is
thinking, or experiencing something?  Is our
conception of the mind compatible with a scientific
outlook?  Could a computer think?  Can animals?The course will draw primarily on short readings from

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will be concerned with the problem of philosophical skepticism. The course will begin and end with a reading of Descartes’s Meditations, and it will be built around the skeptical arguments of the First Meditation. We will study several responses to those arguments, and we will consider how those responses shape our understanding of what knowledge is. Finally, we will consider how Descartes himself understood the import of those skeptical arguments. Readings will be from Descartes, Stroud, Austin, Moore, Broughton, and others. We will also consider the role of skeptical scenarios in contemporary movies such as The Matrix, Fight Club, and The Truman Show.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.Previously taught:

Particular focus will be on close, critical reading of philosophical texts, written in a variety of philosophical genres. Students will examine a number of metaphysical and epistemological problems, and lectures will seek to locate these problems within a broader historical context, particularly emphasizing the influence of the Scientific Revolution on the development of modern philosophy. Topics covered will include: the debate about innate ideas, arguments for the existence of God, the nature of material substance, the relation between mind and body, the distinction between primary and secondary qualities, causation, induction, skepticism and the use of skeptical arguments in philosophical reflection, the nature of space and time, and the possibility of metaphysics.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy–and, for
the uninitiated, to philosophy itself. We will spend almost all of
our time on Socrates (469-399 BC), Plato (427-347 BC), and Aristotle
(384-322 BC), with a passing glance at pre-Socratic and Hellenistic
philosophers. Our primary goal will be to understand each philosopher’s
characteristic methods and views, and (more importantly) his reasons
for holding these views.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will be devoted to a close examination of the development of Plato’s theory of Forms from itd first traces in early dialogues to possible revisions in later dialogues.  The examination will also include questions of the development in Plato’s epistemology and method of dialectic.  We will discuss the treatment of these topics in Plato’s Euthyphro, Meno, Phaedo, Republic, Parmenides, Sophist, and the Philebus.  Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe single most important question in philosophy – and in intellectual life generally – at the present time is this:  How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles?
    This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind.  What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes?  How does it function causally in our behavior?  How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes?  What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action?  Do we have free will?  Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will?  Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings?  Are our brains really just digital computers?  How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments?  This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.  Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will survey the basic questions of moral and political philosophy, as well as some classic attempts to answer them.  The questions that we will ask include: What is the morally right thing for me to do?  Why should I do it?  Is there a fact of the matter what it is, or does it just depend on my feelings or upbringing?  Why should I do what the government tells me to?  Why should I tolerate alien moral beliefs and practices?  The philosophers whose work we will read include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Bentham, Mill, and Nietzsche.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein.  We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege and Russell.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaLogic is about reasoning, the difference between good and bad  reasoning, and how to tell the difference between good and bad  reasoning.In this course, we will develop techniques for laying bare the  structure of arguments (“reasonings”). This will enable us then to  characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and  bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These  three things — a conception of structure of arguments, a precise  characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their  structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning — constitute a  “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of  logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to  properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we  will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of  the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in  typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put  into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which  the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a  conclusion.Textbook: Modern Logic by Graeme Forbes, Oxford University Press, 1994.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to themes in the philosohy of mind and cognitive science. Readings will be taken from philosophy and cognitive science. The course will explore a radical proposal: that the mind is not in the head, that the brain is not the mind, that you are not your brain. A wealth of findings in empirical science and philosophy point in this direction. This course is organized around this issue.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will consider whether and under what conditions it might be morally permissible to kill another person. We will consider a variety of situations in which killing has been thought to be morally justified, such as self-defense, the conduct of a just war, the administration of justice (capital punishment), and the alleviation of acute suffering (euthanasia). In considering the permissibility of killing under these various circumstances we will be forced to address fundamental questions about the nature of morality and the value of human life. Readings will be taken from contemporary philosophical discussions (available in a course reader). Students will be expected to attend all seminar meetings and to participate in seminar discussions. In addition, there will be two short papers (1-2 pages). 1 unit; P/NP.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA course to encourage in philosophy majors the practice and development of the skills of reading and writing in philosophy.  Readings will be drawn from recent essays on a variety of subjects in different areas of philosophy.  These will be discussed in one two-hour classroom meeting each week.  Students will be expected to read and discuss the essays in class and to write clearly and accurately about them and about the questions they raise.  Each student will meet individually each week with a graduate student instructor for close assessment and discussion of the student’s writing with special attention to how it could be improved.  There will be a final paper on a topic of the student’s choice.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will seek to examine fundamental features of politics by considering the basic concepts we employ for this purpose. It will focus, in particular, on the concept of the political and argue that our traditional understanding of that concept has now disintegrated and that we must endeavor to conceive of politics in new ways.In the course of this undertaking we will look at the writings of a number of political philosophers, including specifically Plato and Aristotle as well as Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, and Micheal Foucault.Texts:Plato   Protagoras and Meno.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaYou seem to be subject to two different kinds of “ought”: two different kinds of normative demand.  On the one hand, you are subject to demands that the world makes on you.  Some fact of your situation, we might say, is a /reason /for you to believe or do something.  Because the hunter was caught red handed, you have reason to believe that he was poaching.  Because Moses Hall is on fire, you have reason to leave.  On the other hand, you are subject to demands that your attitudes make on one another, however the world may be.  Some attitude that you have, we might say, makes it /irrational /of you to have or fail to have some other attitude, whether or not you have reason for or against any of those attitudes.  Because you believe that Berkeley is west of San Francisco, it would be irrational of you to believe that Berkeley is east of San Francisco.  Because you intend to vote for Nader, it would be irrational of you to fail to intend to go to the polling station.  The topic of this seminar is the relation between these two kinds normative demand.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaTheory of knowledge, or epistemology, is concerned with the nature and possibility of knowledge. In this class we will consider some of the central questions that are discussed in contemporary theory of knowledge, for example the questions of what distinguishes knowledge from true belief, what considerations can justify a claim to knowledge, and what sorts of replies can be offered to skeptical arguments against the possibility of knowledge.  We will be concerned in particular with empirical knowledge, and more specifically the kind of knowledge that we derive from the use of our senses (for example, the knowledge I have, when I see a blue cup, that there is a blue cup in front of me).  While we will begin by reading Descartes, most of the readings will be drawn from contemporary sources.Prerequisite: Philosophy 25B or its equivalentPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaContemporary philosophy of mathematics offers us an embarrassment of riches. Among the major areas of work one could list developments of the classical foundational programs (neo-logicism, modified Hilbert’s program, varieties of constructivism etc.), analytic approaches to epistemology and ontology of mathematics (nominalism, platonism etc.), and developments at the intersection of history and philosophy of mathematics (Lakatos and others). But anyone even partially familiar with contemporary philosophy of mathematics will not have failed to notice a loud call for approaches to the philosophy of mathematics that will pay closer attention to mathematical practice than has hitherto been the case. The seminar will focus on this latter direction of work. It will be divided into two parts. The first part will cover some approaches to the philosophy of mathematical practice from the 1960s to the 1990s (Lakatos, Kitcher, and Maddy, among others). The second part will consist of readings from a new generation of philosophers of mathematics whose appeal to mathematical practice differs in significant ways from those studied in the first part of the seminar. Most of the readings for the second part will come from a forthcoming volume, “The Philosophy of Mathematical Practice”, which I am editing for Oxford University Press. Among the topics to be covered are diagrammatic reasoning, visualization, explanation, purity of methods, fruitfulness of concept, etc. Time permitting, some attention will be devoted to the philosophical problems emerging from developments in category theory, computer science, and mathematical physics. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA seminar devoted to discussion of the questions: What is involved in (a) a person’s meaning something determinate by 
an expression?
   (b) a person’s understanding an expression in a 
determinate way?
   © our attributing such a meaning or 
understanding to someone?The goal is to explore the capacities for meaning and understanding that we implicitly attribute to those to whom we attribute propositional and other attitudes.  A large part of the seminar (as much as is needed) will be devoted to detailed discussion of most of Saul Kripke’s Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language.  Close reading of that book will be presupposed.  Other readings will be drawn from some of the many responses to that book and from elsewhere.The intention of the seminar is to carry on a general, focussed discussion of these questions and their implications wherever they seem interesting.  Active participation by all those in attendance is expected.  Suggestions of topics to be discussed, or presentations suggested by participants, are welcome.  There is no fixed agenda for the seminar.  These issues have been at the center of much philosophical discussion for some years, and this seminar is an opportunity to discuss them as things stand now.Required reading: Saul A.

It will focus on the con-cept of happiness or well-being and the requisite virtues.  It will also elucidate the Aristotelian explanation for the phenomenon called ‘weakness of the will’, his conception and evaluation of pleasure, the importance of friendship, and take up the controversy whether Aristotle’s ex-planation of the supreme good represents a tension in his system.
Course-requirements: two to three presentations in the seminar, one final research-paper.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaOur focus will be on McDowell’s and Merleau-Ponty’s views on perception and action.  We will spend the first third of the semester focussing on McDowell’s Mind and World (1994) and on readings immediately related to it.  In the middle part of the semester we will read extracts from Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception (1945/1962).  Readings for the third part of the semester are still to be determined but will probably include some of McDowell’s more recent writings, and also some recent work and draft writings by one or both of the instructors.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will acquaint students with key thinkers from the Zhou dynasty through the end of the Qing dynasty.  While the course is arranged chronologically, we will also take up more thematic considerations, such as the development of statecraft, the idea of the self, and the discourse on kinship.  Much of class time will be devoted to careful readings of primary sources in translation, with attention to major themes and modes of argument.  In addition to preparing for class discussion, students will be asked to write three short papers (approximately three pages each).  The first of these will be a close reading of a short passage selected by the student.  The second short paper will compare the treatment of an idea or theme in two sources, and the third paper will examine the historical trajectory of a key term or theme.  In addition there will be an in-class midterm and a final exam.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe aim of this course will be to explore certain traditional problems in the philosophy of mind in terms of recent work in philosophy and cognitive science. We will be discussing such traditional problems as the mind-body problem, the nature of intentionality, and the nature of consciousness in light of recent discussions which use computer models of cognition or which try to cast doubt on our ordinary, common-sense conceptions of the mental. These views include functionalism, artificial intelligence, eliminative materialism, parallel distributed processing, and others.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five units in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Personal 
Identity, Functionalism, Consciousness, and Causation. The books required for the course are: David Chalmers (ed.), Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002). John Perry (ed.), Personal Identity, (Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press 1975).What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? We shall begin the course by looking at these fundamental questions about the nature of the psychological. What is a person? Is a person merely a biological entity, and the identity of a person just the identity of a physical thing? Do psychological states enter into the identity of the self, or can we explain the continued existence of the self in terms that do not appeal to psychological states? And what is the importance of personal identity? Recently some theorists have argued that we should give it much less weight than we seem to ordinarily; we will look at those arguments. One of the most powerful ideas in contemporary philosophy of mind is functionalism, the idea that the character of a mental state is constituted by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior. In the third unit we look at the strengths and limitations of this idea. One limitation of functionalism is its trouble in providing an analysis of consciousness. What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? We will try to identify the aspects of conscious experience that make it difficult to explain this characteristic of the mental life in physicalist terms. In one way or another, throughout this course we will be going over the relation of the psychological life to the physical. Finally, we will look at how psychological states can be said to have causes and effects. Do we in fact ordinarily take it that psychological states do have causes and effects? And can they do so, if the whole causal story of the world can be told entirely in terms of physics?Previously taught:

    This course will compare and contrast the Greek, Medieval and Modern worlds as expressed in their greatest literature. We will follow in detail how in the West polytheism gradually became more and more monolithic until everything was understood in relation to a single God, and then how this synthesis fell apart and left our culture with a choice between nihilism and a return to polytheism.  The goal of the course is both to illustrate how to read difficult texts and to provide an understanding of the cultural paradigms that have formed and focused our shared beliefs and practices.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicate the intuitive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’ and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’. In addition, we will also develop techniques to show when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics. We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPerception and RealityOne of our main ways of finding out about the world is through perceptual experience of it: for example, through seeing, hearing and touching things.  But there is a great deal that is puzzling about what perceptual experience is, and about how (or indeed, whether) it makes knowledge possible.  Some of the puzzles are best dealt with in experimental psychology and physiology, for example by looking at how the sense-organs and brain function in perception. But some of the questions which arise about perception and its relation to knowledge are primarily philosophical, rather than psychological or physiological.  Many important philosophers, including Aristotle, Descartes and Kant, have dealt with these questions, and indeed have treated them as central in understanding the nature of reality and our knowledge of it.  Moreover, questions about perception remain central in contemporary philosophy of mind and theory of knowledge.  In this seminar we will read and discuss a number of philosophical texts dealing with perception and knowledge, some classical and some more recent.  Because the topic is a large one, we will not be trying to cover it comprehensively, but rather to study carefully a few selected texts.  While the texts will be difficult and require careful reading, the class will not presuppose any prior knowledge of philosophy; it is intended to give students an opportunity to get acquainted with philosophy in a small class with a lot of emphasis on discussion.  Students taking the course should be prepared to participate actively in class discussion. They will be required to write a short paper each week and a longer final paper at the end of the semester.Admission to the course is by the consent of the instructor only, and is restricted to freshmen and sophomores.  Those wishing to take the course will need to submit an application including a short essay (between one and two pages) on a topic set by the instructor. If you are interested in enrolling, you should contact the instructor by email before Friday, December 1.  Emails should be addressed to ginsborg@berkeley.edu and should include “Philosophy 39” in the subject line.  Those sending emails before the deadline will receive an application form and the essay topic by email, and will have about a week to send back the application.  Students will be informed by mid-December whether they are admitted to the course. Students who are admitted to the course and who attend the first class meeting will receive a class entry code and will be able to enroll through TeleBEARS during the first week of classes.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is restricted to Philosophy majors.

This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the problem of personal identity. There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading. In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper.Course readings: /Personal Identity/, edited by John Perry, University of California Press.Previously taught:

Political philosophy asks different questions, which it is less clear that we can settle empirically.  Some of these questions are conceptual.  What makes a particular form of human interaction political?  Other questions are normative.  What sort of government should we have?  How should we, as individuals, relate to it?This course surveys the major works of political philosophy of the 17thˆ19th centuries, by Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau (in the social contract tradition), and by Hume, Bentham, and Mill (in the utilitarian tradition).  To provide context and contrast, briefer readings will be drawn from Aristotle; Filmer (a critic of Hobbes in turn criticized by Locke); and Whewell, De Tocqueville, and Stephen (contemporaries of Mill).The course will be more interpretive than many philosophy classes.  Although we may hope to learn something about the questions that interest us, we will be discussing, in the first instance, the questions that interested the authors.  Furthermore, our interpretations will have a different focus from courses on the same texts in other departments.  There will be greater emphasis on normative foundations than on institutional design, and greater emphasis on the internal logical structure of the arguments than on their author‚s rhetoric or immediate political aims.  For this reason, some experience with philosophical reasoning is essential.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will be a survey of contemporary epistemology.  The first  part of the course will involve examinations of various sources of  justification and knowledge (including perception, memory,  consciousness, reason, and testimony).  The second part of the course  will be concerned with the structure and growth of justification and  knowledge (this will include topics such as inference and the  extension of knowledge, foundationalism, and coherentism).  The third  and final part of the course will be about the nature and scope of  justification and knowledge and the problem of skepticism (this will  include attempts to analyze knowledge in terms of justification,  truth, and other concepts, naturalistic accounts of knowledge, and  problems for such analyses like the Gettier problem, and  skepticism).  We will use both a textbook and a collection of primary  texts by various epistemologists (mainly, contemporary ones, but also  some ancient and early modern philosophers).Required texts:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is a course in general philosophy of science. We study five topics of central importance where formal methods, especially probabilistic approaches, have brought progress. We ask: What makes something a scientific explanation?, What is required for observations to confirm (support) a hypothesis?, Is simplicity a guide to truth?, Is coherence a guide to truth?, and Does the success of science give us reason to believe its theories are true? Topics covered include the problem of induction, some paradoxes of confirmation, and the advantages and disadvantages of Bayesianism. Prerequisite: one course in philosophy.Previously taught:

very cold,” I can say something about Pluto, something whose truth or
falsity depends on how things are millions of miles from Earth. How is
this possible? What gives our words and sentences semantic properties
(meaning, reference, truth)? Clearly, the semantic properties of words
depend somehow on our thoughts and intentions: but how? And what gives
our mental states their semantic properties? Are the meanings of our
words and the contents of our mental states determined by what’s going
on inside our brains, or do they depend on features of our physical
environments of which we may be unaware? Are they determined by how
things are now, or do they depend on facts about our history (or even our
futures)? Could there be facts about meaning we could only discover by
looking in someone’s brain? Are there objective facts about meaning at
all? In exploring these and related questions, we will read the work of

How is it possible that there can be an objective reality of such things as money, property, government, marriage, and universities, even though such things exist only because we believe they exist? What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail? Are there human rights, and if so what are they and where do they come from?Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course has two parts.  Part One (first 11 weeks) will be more  technical
in nature.  It will involve learning some of the key metalogical  results for
first-order logic (e.g., soundness, completeness, and compactness).  The
goal will be to get through Parts 1-3 of Hunter’s “Metalogic” textbook,
which concludes with a famous metalogical paradox called “Skolem’s  Paradox”.
Part Two (last 4 weeks) will be more philosophical in nature.  It will
involve investigating the historical impact (on 20th century analytic
philosophy) of the metalogical results covered in Part One of the  course.
For instance, we will discuss the influence of “Skolem’s Paradox” on the
philosophical development of W.V.O. Quine and Hilary Putnam.Prerequisites. PHIL 12A, and willingness to engage both in  mathematical and

Students will be expected to read carefully, to discuss, and to write clearly and perceptively about those works and the problems they raise.  No specific prerequisites; completion of at least Philosophy 25B is strongly advised.  The richer one’s background in philosophy and the more one reads and thinks and discusses with others, the more one will get from the course.  A large body of secondary literature and commentary can be helpful, but the emphasis throughout will be on the words and ideas of Hume himself.Lectures will discuss primarily but not exclusively the following topics: 
    Introduction-the science of human nature;
    Operations of the mind: the theory of impressions and ideas;
    The idea of causation and its source in experience;
    Belief and the sources of beliefs about the unobserved;
    The idea of necessary connection;
    The continued and distinct existence of objects; 
    The self: the idea of personal identity;
    Paradox, sceptical despair and its cure;
    Action and its source in feeling or passion;
    Freedom and necessity;
    Morality and its sources: not derived from reason;
        Feeling, sentiment, and sympathy as the basis of morality;
    The origin and rationale of justice as an ‘artificial virtue’;
    The origin of government and the source of political obligation;
    The human point or goal of philosophy.Course requirements:

M. W. F. 12-1After a survey of the political ideas contained in early Greek poetry, philosophy, and the innovations imported by the Sophists, the course will focus on the political theories of Plato and Aristotle.  In particular, it will work out an analysis of Plato’s views on the ideal state expressed in the Republic and in the Laws and of Aristotle’s notion of the function of the state, the meaning of citizenship and the different kinds of constitutions in the Politics.  Attention will also be given to the changes in the political views of the Hellenistic age – most importantly concerning the Stoic attitude towards the state and citizenship.  Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course is meant to serve as an introduction to Foucault’s work and will 
deal with the three phases in the work that Foucault himself distinguished: 
                  his concern with the epistemic structure of knowledge claims 
                  in the human and social sciences (roughly, Foucault’s work in the 
                  1960’s);
                  his preoccupation with power, sexuality, and politics (in the 1970’s);
                  and his examination of the processes of self-formation (in the1980’s).Special attention will be given to Foucault’s middle period. 
The course will focus on a close reading of The Order of Things,
Discipline and Punish, The History of Sexuality, vol. 1,Power/knowledge,
and The Use of Pleasure, plus a reader with a selection of shorter writings.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course covers some of the most important metalogical results that are of interest to philosophers. It is divided into three parts. The first two parts are mathematical in style whereas the last part is philosophical. In the first part we will cover the basic notions of computability theory and study in detail the Turing machine approach to computability. The second part of the course will give a detailed presentation of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and related results. Finally, we will look at the philosophical relevance of these logical results to various areas of philosophy. Phil 140A is not a prerequisite for this course.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHow are we to describe the role of spatial representation in thought  and perception?  What types of spatial representation are there, and  how do they bear on perception of objects?  What is the relation  between spatial representation and first-person thinking?  And  finally, what is the relation between spatial representation and our  understanding of causation?

After considering the place of biology in  Aristotle’s philosophy of nature we will look at specific issues  concerning the stuctures involved in biological inquiry and  explanation with particular emphasis on the connection between data  and theory, and the role of final causes (teleology) in biological  explanation.  We will the consider some of the key metaphysical  concepts that are presupposed by his explanatory and definitional  practices in biology, including the nature and role of essentialism  and natural kinds.REQUIRED TEXT:Philosophical Issues in Aristotle’s Biology  (Paperback)

Plato’s treatment of this question raises significant questions: They concern the sceptical atti-tude expressed in the sophist Protagoras’ maxime that man is the measure of all things, and in the flux-theory of the extreme Heracliteans.  A further intriguing problem concerns the status of non-being and saying or thinking what is not.  The dialogue’s negative end, despite some promising manoeuvres, leaves open to speculation what are the ultimate conditions of Plato’s epistemology and metaphysics.  Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPutnam’s classic paper “Brains and Behavior” argued that the relation between pain and behavior was causal, not constitutive. Apart from its substantive conclusions – that logical behaviorism is false; that pains and other mental states are not dispositions to behave – the paper is a landmark in twentieth-century philosophical methodology raising important questions about how to do philosophy and calling cherished assumptions into question. Among the issues put into play in this paper are: the role of thought experiments in philosophy; the relation between philosophy and science; the limits of verificationism; the relation between conceivability and possibility; the demarcation between epistemology and metaphysics; the distinction between causal and constitutive relationships.The aim of this seminar is to explore themes in the contemporary philosophy of neuroscience and consciousness against the background of the issues raised by Putnam’s original paper. Among the questions we shall examine in this setting are: What is consciousness? Can there be experience without “access consciousness”? Are neural systems alone sufficient for consciousness? Are you your brain? These questions are important and worthwhile in themselves; in thinking about them it is hoped that we can also rethink the legacy of Putnam’s “Brains and Behavior.”Among the philosophical authors we will read in the seminar are: Block, Chalmers, Noë and Putnam. This is a research seminar for graduate students; students may be expected to make presentations. In exceptional circumstances undergraduates will be permitted to take this course.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThere is a recent growing interest in forms of mental life involving more
 than one person.  Traditional the philosophy of mind takes a single person 
as the locus of mental phenomena.  In this seminar, we will explore those 
forms of intentionality that are essentially social.  We will examine their relation 
to consciousness and the role that they play in the existence of social institutions and social facts generally.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaRecent Work in Moral PhilosophyThe seminar will be devoted to a close reading of two new works in systematic moral philosophy: The Second-Person Standpoint by Stephen Darwall, and Climbing the Mountain by Derek Parfit. Darwall’s book explores the “essentially interpersonal” character of moral obligation, investigating the implications of this feature of morality for questions about the authority and normative significance of moral demands. Parfit’s (still-unpublished) manuscript attempts to “develop and combine existing [moral] theories of three kinds: Kantian, contractualist, and consequentialist”; he argues that these three theories, when properly interpreted, converge on a single way of understanding moral requirements. The study of these two books should introduce seminar participants to some of the central questions in moral philosophy, while exposing them systematically to the views of two important contemporary philosophers.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaKant on Causality: We will examine Kant’s early views on causality, as well as the mature theory presented in The Critique of Pure Reason.

the mind, and also as an introduction to philosophy for those who have not

What is a mind? Can the mental be explained simply in terms of brain
processes? What is involved in having beliefs, desires, and other mental
states that are directed towards the world? How does perception put us in
touch with the world? Students will learn to critically read philosophical

This will enable us then to characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These three things — a conception of structure of arguments, a precise characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning — constitute a “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a conclusion.Textbook: Modern Logic by Graeme Forbes, Oxford University Press, 1994.Previously taught:

modern western philosophy, i.e. philosophy from Europe
during roughly the 17th and 18th centuries.  The
Scientific Revolution had only recently kicked off and
was developing rapidly during this time, and the
philosophy we will be looking at was hugely affected
by this phenomenon.  We will be examining the two
primary philosophical approaches ? now known as
Rationalism and Empiricism ? that arose to deal with
the pressing issues of the time; two questions, in
particular, will be the focus of the course, one
metaphysical and the other epistemological.  The first
asks about the basic structure of reality (about the
nature of God, of mind, of material things, etc.)
while the second asks how we as thinkers/perceivers
relate to the world around us (do we know it?s out
there at all?  If so, how?).Previously taught:

be on moral theory–that is, on the theory of what we are morally
obligated or permitted to do (or refrain from doing) and why–but we will
also explore how the demands that morality makes on us interact with other
reasons for action.We will address various concrete moral issues, including the morality of
capital punishment, abortion, war, affirmative action, and taxation. We
will also take up more abstract questions: do moral statements purport to
represent objective moral facts, or are they instead expressions of the
feelings of the person making the statement? If they try to represent
objective moral facts, do they succeed? If there are objective moral
facts, are they relative to time, the culture of the agent, etc.; or are
they independent of these frameworks?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to philosophy by taking up just one of its many and varied topics: knowledge.   We will consider three big questions.  What is knowledge?  Do we have any knowledge?   What are some of the general kinds of knowledge to be had?  We will draw on some of the very best philosophical texts, old and new, that engage with these questions.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is a general introduction to the central philosophical doctrines of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  We will focus on the ethical, metaphysical, and epistemological doctrines of these philosophers, with an emphasis on the methodology they use in arguing for their conclusions.  Among the issues we will discuss are their views of the best human life, the nature of the soul, the fundamental constituents of reality, scientific explanation, and the difference between knowledge and true belief.  In addition to attempting to understand the views of these philosophers and why they held them, we will critically assess the merits of the views in question.  Thus, this course also doubles as an introduction to philosophy.  As such, it presupposes no background in philosophy.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPhenomenology was – besides analytic philosophy – one of the two great philosophical movements of the 20th century. It has been praised for addressing topics more relevant to real people’s life, but blamed for relatively lower standards of clarity and for failure to deliver on its over-ambitious goals. It has been more influential than analytic philosophy outside of academic philosophy (and is thus important in many areas of cultural studies), and within philosophy there have been repeated attempts to combine the life-relevance of phenomenology with the clarity and modesty of analysis.In this course, we shall focus on close reading and critical explanation of selections from three classics of the movement, Edmund Husserl’s Cartesian Meditations (1929) and Crisis of European Sciences (1936) and Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception (1945). 1st weekHusserl, /Cartesian Meditations/ (§§ 1-20)2nd weekHusserl, /Cartesian Meditations/ (§§ 21-41, 63-64)3rd weekHusserl, /Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology/ (§§ 1-16 and Supplement VI.)4th weekHusserl, /Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology/ (§§ 33-55)5th weekMerleau-Ponty, /Phenomenology of Perception/ (tba)6th weekMerleau-Ponty, /Phenomenology of Perception/ (tba)Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will survey the basic questions of moral and political philosophy, as well as some classic attempts to answer them. The questions that we will ask include: What is the morally right thing for me to do? Why should I do it? Is there a fact of the matter what it is, or does it just depend on my feelings or upbringing? Why should I do what the government tells me to? Why should I tolerate alien moral beliefs and practices? The philosophers whose work we will read include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Bentham, Mill, and Nietzsche.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five units in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Personal Identity, Functionalism, Consciousness, and Causation. The books required for the course are: David Chalmers (ed.), Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002). John Perry (ed.), Personal Identity, (Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press 1975).What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? We shall begin the course by looking at these fundamental questions about the nature of the psychological. What is a person? Is a person merely a biological entity, and the identity of a person just the identity of a physical thing? Do psychological states enter into the identity of the self, or can we explain the continued existence of the self in terms that do not appeal to psychological states? And what is the importance of personal identity? Recently some theorists have argued that we should give it much less weight than we seem to ordinarily; we will look at those arguments. One of the most powerful ideas in contemporary philosophy of mind is functionalism, the idea that the character of a mental state is constituted by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior. In the third unit we look at the strengths and limitations of this idea. One limitation of functionalism is its trouble in providing an analysis of consciousness. What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? We will try to identify the aspects of conscious experience that make it difficult to explain this characteristic of the mental life in physicalist terms. In one way or another, throughout this course we will be going over the relation of the psychological life to the physical. Finally, we will look at how psychological states can be said to have causes and effects. Do we in fact ordinarily take it that psychological states do have causes and effects? And can they do so, if the whole causal story of the world can be told entirely in terms of physics?Previously taught:

These  three things — a conception of structure of arguments, a precise  characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their  structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning — constitute a  “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of  logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to  properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we  will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of  the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in  typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put  into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which  the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a  conclusion.Textbook: Modern Logic by Graeme Forbes, Oxford University Press, 1994.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy–and, for the
uninitiated, to philosophy itself. We will spend almost all of our time
on the three most important Greek philosophers–Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle–with a passing glance at pre-Socratic and Hellenistic
philosophers. Our primary goal will be to understand these philosophers’
characteristic methods and views, and (more importantly) their reasons
for holding these views. It is often said that we should study ancient
Greek philosophy because it is the intellectual basis for all later
western philosophy and natural science. That is true, but it is only
half the story. We should also study ancient Greek philosophy to become
familiar with a worldview so alien that it throws our own into sharp
relief. As you are outraged by some of the things these philosophers
say, you will come to see more clearly what your own views are, and you
will be forced to ask what justifies them. You will not just be studying
the history of philosophy; you will be doing philosophy. Prerequisite:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will be taught in seminar format, with one weekly three-hour
meeting and enrollment limited to twenty students. The topic of the
seminar is equality and needs. Issues that will be raised include the
following: How should we understand the political ideal of equality?
Is there is something which justice requires people to have equal
amounts of? If so, what? If not, is what matters that we have sufficient
resources for flourishing? Should we give priority to the least
well-off? What is the connection between the values of equality and
fairness?The course is intended for juniors and seniors with substantial
background in philosophy. Philosophy 115 or the equivalent is a
prerequisite, and the course will presuppose familiarity with Rawls’ A
Theory of Justice. Readings will be drawn from a range of historical
and contemporary sources: Rousseau, G. A. Cohen, Temkin, Dworkin,

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaBy any (reasonable) account, human beings have more knowledge today than ever before due to the progress of science, but there is still philosophical disagreement about what knowledge is, how we should respond to radical skepticism, and how much science itself can tell us about knowledge. In this problem-oriented course we will study contemporary classics of epistemology on the topics of tracking, closure, relevant alternatives, reliabilism, internalism, externalism, and contextualism, among others.  We will take epistemology to be responsible for understanding scientific cases of knowledge, and also consider the implications for epistemology of results in experimental psychology suggesting human beings’ lack of awareness of their true reasons for belief.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaFrom the earliest point in our lives we mark a distinction between the social world of animate beings and the inanimate objects about us. The distinctions we make are fundamental to our ways of finding out about the world and responding to what we discover there. But do the distinctions we mark reflect ultimate differences in the nature of the world around us? These are the questions addressed in this course. We will be looking at some of the oldest and most fundamental questions about the mind: the nature of consciousness, knowledge of our own minds and of others’; physicalism and dualism; functionalism.Previously taught:

It is divided into three parts. The first two parts are mathematical in style whereas the last part is philosophical. In the first part we will cover the basic notions of computability theory and study in detail the Turing machine approach to computability. The second part of the course will give a detailed presentation of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and related results. Finally, we will look at the philosophical relevance of these logical results to various areas of philosophy.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaLocke’s Essay concerning Human Understanding, published in 1689, is one of the few most influential works in general philosophy that have ever been written.  Locke’s was a leading voice in favor of a reasonable, tolerant, and anti-dogmatic  (more or less ‘modern’) approach to the natural world, to society and to religion.  His theory of knowledge, part of this wider campaign, was supported by shrewd and subtle philosophical argument that was highly respected throughout Europe for well over a century – even by such opponents and critics as Leibniz and Kant.  Since then it has often been underrated and misrepresented, but his thought is of great philosophical as well as historical interest and importance.The Essay is a long book, and is constructed in an order that would have been more familiar to his first readers.  Ayers’ Locke follows a rather different order, but is also regrettably long.  Students who take this course will not be expected to read either ‘required’ book from beginning to end (though they won’t be discouraged from doing so).  We will start by reading a selection of passages taken from different parts of the Essay, not necessarily with the aim of explaining the structure and philosophical motivation of Locke’s theories – an overall grasp of his strategy.  Then we shall look at specific arguments and questions of interpretation in greater detail, as well as exploring the wider philosophical issues that they raise.  The latter include the nature of knowledge and its relation to belief, the basic role of the senses, what thinking is, the relation between physical and logical necessity, the relations between language, thought and reality (for example, how far our classifications have an objective basis in reality), and what the identity of things and persons consists in.  (A lot of work has been done on Locke since I wrote about him, and I expect to have to revise some earlier views.)A student unfamiliar with the Essay might usefully look first at the following passages (about 190 pages in all). They do not include some very important topics (eg identity, classification, estimation of probability, the relation between faith and reason), but should give an overall idea of what Locke is about.Book I ch I,  ch ii,  and ch iv sections 1-3 and 22-25;

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will trace the historical and philosophical development  of confirmation theory (aka., pure and applied inductive logic) from  1900-2007.  The main historical figures will include (among others):  Johnson, Keynes, Nicod, Hempel, Carnap, Goodman, Quine, Salmon,  Skyrms, Joyce, and yours truly.  All readings will be provided on the  seminar website.  [There are no prerequisites for this seminar, but  it will presuppose some basic propositional logic and high-school  algebra.]Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe Seminar will study Plato’s Sophist, one of his latest works.  In the
search of the definition of the sophist the participants of the dialogue
focus on central concepts such as being and not-being, on the nature of
language, and on questions of methodology.  The Sophist is by general
consent one of Plato’s hardest, but also most rewarding works for the
understanding of his philosophy.
The seminar will provide a careful analysis of the arguments and a study
of the dialogue’s unity and its relation to other Platonic works.  At the
same time a series of articles will be included that have contributed most
to a better understanding of this complex dialogue in recent years.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe seminar will be devoted to a detailed reading and analysis of some major topics in Wittgenstein’s_ Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. In addition to the Tractatus_, we will also take into account Wittgenstein’s earlier Notebooks, Notes on logic, and Notes dictated to G. E. Moore.Texts:

Some tomatoes lack this look, and other entities – fake tomatoes – can possess the look and thereby mislead someone about what they are. Nonetheless when you see a tomato in plain view you can see it for what it is, a tomato: that something is a tomato would seem to be a perceptible aspect of it. When someone feels resentful, that attitude may be expressed in the way they look at others, how they move, or in the manner of their speech. A skilled actor can mimic such expressions so as to appear resentful too. This doesn’t rule out our coming to know in propitious circumstances that someone is resentful just by looking at them or listening to them. Yet many think that the person’s resentment is not itself a perceptible aspect of the scene: our access to it is mediated through the person’s behaviour or what is expressive of this feeling.Why should one suppose that there is this difference between the appearance of kinds of fruit and the expressions of feeling or emotion? That is the question we shall be pursuing in this seminar. The aim will be to look at some of the traditional discussions of the problem of other minds; the elusive status of appearance; and the relation between emotional states and their expression.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe purpose of the seminar is to present and assess Rawls’s seminal 
book in its entirety, as a single project, placing it in its 
historical and ethical wider context. This will allow us a.) to 
highlight the importance of Rawls’s ambition to rival classical 
utilitarians in shaping the form of his theory; and b.) to bring to 
light how TJ constitutes a systematic theory embracing moral 
doctrines and social and economic facts, at the same time placing 
them in a contractualist framework.The seminar will focus on Rawls’s conception of justice, as 
developed in the revised edition of A Theory of Justice (TJ), and 
Justice as Fairness a Restatement (JRF). JFR is a succinct, revised 
statement of the idea of justice as fairness. In it, Rawls recasts 
the basic arguments for the two principles central to his conception 
of justice, responds to common objections, but also corrects what he 
came to see as mistakes in TJ. By going back and forth between TJ 
and the mature statement of the theory in JRF, the seminar will 
address interpretative questions regarding the very idea of Justice 
as Fairness, the Original Position and the knowledge that the 
parties are in possession of or deprived from, the idea of 
Reflective Equilibrium, the Basic Structure as subject, the 
Difference Principle, Reasonable Overlapping Consensus, and the 
difference between Political Liberalism and Comprehensive Liberalism.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe examine the thesis that justified belief requires not access to one’s own mind but rather the distinct, and often non-conscious, capacity of self-monitoring, and that the purpose of self-monitoring is self-correction. We discuss notions of justified belief in epistemology and Bayesianism, consider a new self-monitoring notion of justified belief based on second-order tracking, and relate it to the notion of calibration in Bayesianism, statistics, and psychologists’ studies of human beings’ confidence/accuracy ratios. We apply the new self-monitoring rationality requirements proposed for the relation between first- and second-order beliefs to the Preface Paradox, Moore’s Paradox, the Commitment Paradox, the Paradox of Entailment, and the problem of formulating fallibilism, in order to explain both why there is a tension in each of these cases and why there is nevertheless no contradictionHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaGlobal JusticeThere is a vigorous debate among political philosophers about whether there are norms of distributive justice that apply to the world as a whole.  The primary aim of the seminar will be to take stock of this debate.  In order to do this, we will need to consider a number of related issues, including the moral legitimacy of partiality toward those with whom one has special ties, the moral significance of shared citizenship in particular, the question whether principles of justice apply primarily to individuals or to institutions, the relations between justice and beneficence, and the extent to which affluent individuals have a responsibility to help alleviate poverty and suffering in distant lands.  We will read the works of a number of contemporary authors, including most or all of the following: John Rawls, Thomas Nagel, Charles Beitz, Peter Singer, Richard Miller, Onora O’Neill, Thomas Pogge, Samuel Freeman, A.J. Julius, Michael Blake, Kok-Chor Tan, Garrett Cullity, Andrea Sangiovanni, Joshua Cohen and Charles Sabel, Ronald Dworkin, Mathias Risse, Brian Barry, Allan Buchanan, and Liam Murphy.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will read most of Heidegger’s Being & Time.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe intention is to consider three closely related philosophical topics : 1, the identity and individuation of material objects;
2, the content  and objects of perception and perceptual knowledge;
3, the nature and content of self-knowledge and self-awareness.  Argument will be advanced, from a realist point of view, in supportive explanation of ordinary ways of thinking and talking about people, things, and perception.  A sceptical view will be taken of attempts by analytic philosophers to improve on these basic ways of thinking, for example by proposing surprising ‘analyses’ of natural language, or radically alternative  ontologies and logics.   The idea that intentionality and content are primarily properties of linguistic items of some kind will also be subjected to criticism.  We are animals, and language has evolved on the back of animal experience of the world, including experience of ourselves in the world.   To understand how this is so (it will be suggested) is to begin to understand the structure of natural language.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHow should we be living our lives? We will begin the class with this basic
question raised by Plato’s teacher, Socrates. Trying to answer this question
will eventually lead Plato to make some quite strange claims: the sensible
world is fundamentally unintelligible on its own, definitions are not to be
found in the sensible world, our souls are immortal and contain within them
all knowledge, and we should be ruled by philosopher-kings. How does Plato
start with such a simple question about how to live our lives and end with
such radical claims about politics and the universe as a whole?Plato’s intellectual development begins with his teacher, Socrates,
searching for definitions of the things found in the best lives – things
such as courage, justice, piety and temperance. After examining this
Socratic project, we will follow Plato as he develops the project in his own
directions. One way he develops it is by thinking, not just about how we
should live our individual lives, but also about how we should organize
ourselves politically. Plato also thinks that non-ethical concerns arise
from Socrates’ search for definition in ethics. A basic concern Plato has
is: how can we acquire this knowledge that Socrates is searching for?
Further, what are these definitions that Socrates seeks – where in the world
could one find such a thing? Moreover, Plato becomes interested in how we
can make sense, not of our own lives, but of the world we observe around us.
The course will focus on close reading skills to try to unearth how Plato
argues for such strange and radical answers to these questions.Prerequisite: Philosophy 25APreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will be organized around various attempts to reinterpret the Judeo/Christian God, and to determine in what sense, if at all, such a God is still a living God. We will study Dostoyevsky’s and Kierkegaard’s attempts to preserve a non-theological version of the God of Christianity, as well as Nietzche’s attempt to save us from belief in any version of God offered by our tradition. We will view and discuss three films that deal with related issues.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicate the intuitive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’) and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’). In addition, we will also develop techniques for showing when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics. We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAs a thoughtful person, living in this country, at this time, you  have at some point asked yourself some of the following questions.
Should torture be allowed?  Is there any difference between terrorism  and “collateral damage”?  May we kill enemy soldiers or even  civilians to protect ourselves?  Is capital punishment moral?  Is  abortion?  Whether or not it’s moral, should it be legal?  Should we  let the majority or the courts decide?  Is the government allowed to  take your money and use it in ways you don’t want?  If you have  better grades and higher test scores, do you deserve a spot at UC  more?  Are you allowed to buy yourself an iPod when you could use the  money to save people from starving?  Should you buy a hybrid, rather  than an SUV, when your individual choice is just “a drop in the  bucket” and won’t really affect global warming?These questions can be difficult for many different reasons.  Self- interest, prejudice, and fear can cloud our judgment.  Religious  authorities that we accept on faith, such as the Bible, can give  unclear or conflicting directions.  Finally, it can be hard to be  sure of relevant facts: for example, whether information gained  through torture tends to be reliable, whether the justice system  applies the death penalty consistently, or whether burning fossil  fuels leads to climate change.This course, however, is about another set of difficulties, which  persist when we set aside our personal feelings, we see how far we  can get without relying on faith, and we assume that we know the  relevant facts.  We may not be able to decide, by our own reflection  and reasoning, which answers are correct, and even when we are sure  that certain answers are correct, we may not be able to justify  them.  Our ethical ideas may seem not up to the task.  Our aim in  this course is to come to terms with these difficulties and to see to  what extent they can be overcome.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Some specific topics  we’ll discuss are: Hempel’s paradox of confirmation, Goodman’s “new  riddle of induction”, Carnapian inductive logic, contemporary  Bayesian confirmation theory and Bayesian epistemology, and various  puzzles and paradoxes involving probability and evidence.Prerequisites. PHIL 12A, and willingness to engage both in  mathematical and philosophical work.All readings for the course will be provided via the course website.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course is devoted to a detailed study of the two major formal theories of truth developed in the twentieth century, e.g. Tarski’s (1935) and Kripke’s (1975). When trying to articulate the principles capturing the logic of truth predicates in natural language our intuition leads immediately to the request that the theory should yield all biconditionals of the form “‘p’ is true iff p”. But the liar paradox shows that this naïve principle for truth, together with classical logic, leads to contradiction. Tarski’s solution rests on the distinction between object language (L) and metalanguage (ML) and on imposing as an adequacy condition for a theory of truth that the metalanguage be able to prove all the biconditionals of the above form, where p is restricted to sentences of the object language. Since the truth predicate for L is expressible in ML but not in L, the liar, and similar paradoxes, are blocked. Tarski’s approach dominated the field for forty years. Kripke in 1975 developed a  formal theory of truth using a three valued logic. In his approach paradoxical statements turn out to be neither true nor false. Kripke’s construction leads to a theory of truth in which the truth predicate for L is expressible in L itself. The importance of Tarski’s and Kripke’s theories of truth cannot be overstated; indeed, they are required for a proper understanding of all other formal theories of truth that have been proposed in the last thirty years (revision theory, etc.).
Students taking this course will be required to do a substantial amount of logical work. In the process they will learn topics such as, among others, basics of set theory, many valued logics, fixed points and inductive definitions. Of course, the philosophical implications of Tarski’s and Kripke’s theories will also be discussed. The formal prerequisite is 12A (Introduction to Logic). Familiarity with either Phil 140A or Phil 140B will be an advantage but material covered in those courses will not be presupposed.Textbook: Vann McGee, Truth, Vagueness, and Paradox.

It will end with a brief review of his poetics and rhetoric.  Since Aristotle was concerned with working out the basic principles of each subject and the corresponding methodology, a proper understanding of those princi-ples will be one of the course’s main concerns.  Given the wide scope of Aristotle’s interests the course will have to confine itself to selective investigations of the application Aristotle makes of his principles in the different fields of study.  Since Aristotle’s works are hard to access because of his terse style the readings will focus in the main on an analysis of the se-lected texts taken from (ed.) J. L. Ackrill: A New Aristotle Reader

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThought is directed to the world. But is it an actual relation with the world? This seminar will explore the possibility and plausibility of a theory of direct thought. Topics we will discuss include: the sense and reference of proper names, the conceptuality of experience, overintellectualizing the intellect, and the extended mind. Among the authors we are likely to read are: Clark, McDowell, Gibson, Burge, Merleau-Ponty and Evans.This seminar is designed primarily for graduate students in the philosophy department. Other students with appropriate background will be admitted space permitting.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will examine the idea that some of the things we think and say are assessment-sensitive—that is, true or false only relative to a “context of assessment.” We will be concerned with three main issues:How can we make room for assessment sensitivity in existing
semantic frameworks?  To what extent is provision for assessment
sensitivity a natural extension of these frameworks?How can we make philosophical sense of assessment sensitivity?
What does it mean to say that what is asserted or believed is
true or false only relative to a context of assessment?  What
are the costs of saying this? To what extent is this form of
relativism subject to the usual philosophical objections?What is the motivation for positing assessment sensitivity?  What phenomena can we explain by doing so?  What are the prospects for alternative (and perhaps less radical) explanations of these phenomena?For the sake of concreteness, we will focus first on “predicates of personal taste” (paradigmatically, “tasty”), and then on epistemic and deontic modals. In addition to newer literature that directly concerns assessment sensitivity, we will read some classic literature (both on semantics and on evaluative concepts, obligations, and possibility) that the newer work builds on.Prerequisites: This seminar is primarily intended for graduate
students in Philosophy and Logic and the Methodology of Science.
Other students should seek my permission before continuing. I will not presuppose much background in the philosophy of language, but it would be good if everyone were familiar with the following three articles: Gottlob Frege, “The Thought: A Logical Inquiry” (English translation in Mind 65, 1956, pp. 289-311); H. P. Grice, “Logic and Conversation” (in Studies in the Way of Words, Harvard University Press, 1986); Richard Cartright, “Propositions,” in Philosophical Essays (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1987), 33-53. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this seminar, I want to explore a series of problems in the philosophy of language.  Here are three of them:  First, I am interested in the investigating the prospects of a more naturalistic conception of language that investigates the biological basis of language.  Second, I would like to give a defense of internalism against current externalist attacks on it.  Third, I would like to explain some of my current ideas on the relation of language and social ontology.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will take as its starting point two connected issues: the simplicity of the self and the identity of the self.  The former concerns whether or in what sense the mind could be made up of distinct parts, which is sometimes described as a question about unity at a time; the latter concerns whether or in what sense the mind is something that can persist through change of state, i.e., has unity over time.  Both of these issues are addressed by Kant in the “Paralogisms” section of the Critique of Pure Reason, and play a central role in the “Transcendental Deduction.”  However they were also discussed in depth and considered of fundamental philosophical importance by many philosophers of the early modern period prior to Kant.  Issues concerning the simplicity and identity of the self were thought of as tied to a number of concerns: whether the self could be a material thing, whether the self is a substance and whether that question is answerable by us or even intelligible, whether such skepticism about the self’s being a substance led to consequences that were in some way unacceptable, what the nature of thought and self-awareness is, and what this entails regarding these questions about the self.  We will be discussing the views of Descartes, Locke, Bayle, Clarke, Leibniz, Hume, and finally Kant, on the unity of the self and some of these related questions.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California“Philosophical logic” includes both (a) the philosophical investigation
of the fundamental concepts of logic and (b) the deployment of logical
methods in the service of philosophical ends. We’ll tackle five
interconnecting topics in philosophical logic:Quantifiers: You may think you learned everything there is
to know about quantifiers in Philosophy 12A. But in fact, there are
quite a few quantificational idioms that we can’t understand in terms
of the quantification theory you learned. We’ll look at the logic of
identity, numerical quantifiers, generalized quantifiers, definite
descriptions, substitutional quantifiers, and plural quantifiers.Modal logic:  In addition to talking about what is the case,
we talk about what might have been the case and what could not have
been otherwise.  Modal logic gives us tools to analyze reasoning
involving these notions. We’ll get a basic grasp on some of the
fundamentals of propositional modal logic, and then delve into some
hairy conceptual problems surrounding quantified modal logic,
explored by Quine, Kripke, and others. We’ll also look at the famous
“slingshot argument,” which was used by Quine and Davidson to reject
modal logic and correspondence theories of truth. At this point our
work on definite descriptions will come in handy!Logical consequence: If you ask what logic is about, a reasonable
(though not completely satisfactory) answer is that it’s the study
of what follows from what, that is, of logical consequence. But how
should we think of this relation? We’ll start by looking at Tarski’s
account of logical consequence, which has become the orthodox
account. On this account, logical consequence is a matter of
truth preservation:
P follows from Q if there is no model on which P
is true and Q false. We’ll talk about how this account relates to
the older idea that P follows from Q if it is impossible for
P to be true and Q false. Then we’ll consider some alternatives.
One alternative is to define consequence in terms of proof. We’ll
look at a version of this idea by Dag Prawitz, which yields a
nonclassical logic called “intuitionistic logic.”  We’ll then look
at the suggestion that relevance in addition to truth preservation
is required for logical consequence. We’ll see how one might
develop a nonclassical “relevance logic,” and we’ll consider some
technical and philosophical issues that speak for and against a
requirement of relevance. Finally, we’ll consider how, exactly, logic
relates to reasoning.Conditionals: In Philosophy 12A you were taught to translate
English conditionals using the “material conditional,” a
truth-functional connective. This leads to some odd results: for
example, “If I am currently on Mars, then I am a hippopotamus”
comes out true (since the antecedent is false). We’ll start by
considering some attempts to defend the material-conditional analysis
of indicative conditionals in English. Then we’ll consider some
alternatives, inculding Edgington’s view that indicative conditionals
have no truth-conditions, Stalnaker’s elegant modal account, and the
view that indicative conditionals should be understood as conditional
assertions. Finally, we’ll look at McGee’s “counterexample to modus
ponens,” and consider whether this sacrosanct inference rule is
actually invalid!Vagueness: Finally we’ll turn to the “sorites paradox,” or
paradox of the heap, which argues:  five thousand grains of sand
make a heap; taking one grain away from a heap still leaves you
with a heap; so…one grain of sand makes a heap.  Philosophical
logicians have suggested that it is a mistake to use classical
logic and semantics in analyzing this argument, and they have
proposed a number of alternatives.  We’ll consider three of them:
(a) a three-valued logic, (b) a continuum-valued (or fuzzy) logic,
and © a supervaluational approach that preserves classical
logic (mostly) but not classical semantics.  If there’s time, we’ll
also look at a short argument by Gareth Evans that purports to
show that vagueness must be a semantic phenomenon:  that is, that
there is no vagueness “in the world.”Requirements will include both papers and problem sets.Prerequisites:  Philosophy 12A or equivalent, and at least one other
course in philosophy.  The course covers some technical material,
but knowledge of logic beyond 12A will not be assumed.Books: Course Reader.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will focus on a close reading of Plato’s Meno. Plato seems to
have written the Meno soon after he wrote the early Socratic dialogues and
the Meno addresses many of the basic ethical topics found in these
dialogues: the search for an ethical definition (in this case, “what is
virtue?”), the idea that no one desires what is bad, and the question of
whether virtue is teachable. The Meno breaks from Plato’s earlier writings
by being the first dialogue in which Plato directly discusses
epistemological issues. The topics he raises are of fundamental importance:
whether inquiry is possible, how to use hypotheses in philosophy, how to
distinguish between knowledge and true belief, and why we should value
knowledge. This course will examine these topics through a close reading of
the text, using secondary literature as an aid. We will also look at
relevant passages from other Platonic dialogues so we can think about how
this dialogue fits into Plato’s overall philosophical development.
Throughout the course, I will put particular emphasis on how these new
epistemological questions raise potential difficulties for the ethical
project laid out in the early Socratic dialogues and how Plato’s response to
these questions is designed to resolve these difficulties, thereby securing
Socrates’ ethical project.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHegel’s Metaphysics (Graduate Seminar)The aim of the seminar is to discuss the basic metaphysical assumptions of Hegel’s philosophy and to inquire to what extent these assumptions guide his conception of his ‘system’.

It determines the construction of his logic, his philosophy of mathematics, and his account of meaning and truth. The examination of how Frege wields these two notions can therefore serve as an entry into his work as a whole.Frege has discussed the distinction between concepts and objects most famously in the essay “On Concept and Object” of 1892. That essay will therefore have to be at the center of our attention. But the distinction is already implicit in the construction of his logic in the Begriffsschrift  (of 1879) where it serves to explain the distinction between first- and second level functions. It is absolutely crucial in The Foundations of Arithmetic (of 1884) where Frege argues that numbers are (abstract) objects rather than concepts. What he means here is further elaborated in the essay “Function and Concept” (1891) where Frege interprets concepts as a specific kind of function, e.g., truth-functions. This thesis is, in turn, connected with the claim that the values of truth-functions, the true and the false, are again abstract (logical) objects. Frege’s assertions about the distinction between concepts and objects are often puzzling and sometimes downright paradoxical as in his claim that “the concept ‘horse’ is not a concept.” Many of these puzzles can be resolved and in doing so we come to see that Frege has made some genuine contributions to our understanding of the notions of concept and object. But we also discover real difficulties in his handling of those notions. While the thesis that value-ranges or, more narrowly speaking, classes are logical objects appears to follow directly from his conception, it is also the source of a logical contradiction from which Frege finds it difficult to extract himself. That contradiction threatens, in turn, his entire project of providing logical foundations for arithmetic.Much of what Frege says about the distinction between concepts and objects remains, nevertheless, of philosophical interest. This is evident, for instance, from Donald Davidson’s recent book on truth and predication.Readings: Michael Beaney (ed.), The Frege Reader; Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic; Donald Davidson, Truth and Predication; Class Reader with selected secondary literature.Requirements: a term paper of ca. 15 pages; if possible a class presentation.

Themes from the Recent Work of T. M. Scanlon What are we thinking about, when we think about the “morality” of actions? A theme of T.M. Scanlon’s recent work is that we may be thinking about more than one thing. On the one hand, we may be trying to decide what to do. Within this deliberative perspective, Scanlon suggests, we focus on questions of permissibility. On the other hand, we may be trying to come to terms with what someone’s action says about him, or about his relations to others. Within this evaluative perspective, we focus on questions of meaning. Scanlon suggests that sustained and careful attention to the distinction between permissibility and meaning, or more broadly between the deliberative and evaluative perspectives, promises to illuminate several central questions in ethics. Does what we intend affect the morality what we do? How should we understand the resonant idea that morality is a matter of treating people as “ends, not means”? What is blame? When is it appropriate? Only when it is for something freely chosen? Does what we ought to do depend on the facts, or only the evidence available to us? Does intending something affect what we have reason to do? To provide background, we will begin by reviewing the central chapters of Scanlon’s What We Owe to Each Other. Then we will focus on Scanlon’s unpublished book, Dimensions of Moral Assessment: Meaning, Permissibility, and BlameHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to philosophical
problems about the mind. In the first three weeks, we will focus on the
relationship between the mind and the physical world. We will pursue the
following questions:What is a mind? What are mental states such as beliefs, desires,
feelings and experiences? Are they states of the brain? Are they a
matter of how one behaves? Could a computer have a mind?In the second three weeks, we will look in detail at some more specific
issues raised by our discussion of the questions above:What is the connection between consciousness and the capacity to
represent the world around us (to have mental states which are /about
/the world)? Are mental states in the head? In what ways do they depend
on the world around us? How do we know about other people?s minds?We will read work by philosophers including Hilary Putnam, John Searle
and Thomas Nagel. Students taking the course will be expected to read
this work closely and carefully. They will also be required to write two
papers and sit a final exam.Previously taught:

The Scientific Revolution had only recently kicked off and was developing rapidly during this time, and the philosophy we will be looking at was hugely affected by this phenomenon. We will be examining the two primary philosophical approaches – now known as Rationalism and Empiricism – that arose to deal with the pressing issues of the time; two questions, in particular, will be the focus of the course, one metaphysical and the other epistemological. The first asks about the basic structure of reality (about the nature of God, of mind, of material things, etc.) while the second asks how we as thinkers/perceivers relate to the world around us (do we know it’s out there as all? If so, how?)Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaMost discussion of phenomenal consciousness, whether dualist or physicalist in intent, assumes that we have a grasp of what the stream of consciousness is, or what it is like, independently of our knowledge of other aspects of the world. This is evident in the discussion of the putative identity of pain with some neural process. In this seminar I want to explore some issues which throw doubt on the autonomy of the phenomenal.In particular, I’ll aim to address the following four themes:(A) The Claims of TransparencyRecently it has become popular to insist that introspection of our sense experience confirms that such experience has the ordinary public objects of perception as part of its subject matter. Such a view is presumably rejected by those who suppose that sense perception is nothing but the awareness of non-physical sense-data. Can introspection really support the former view over the latter?For this topic I want to start with some of the recent words of caution by Michael Tye, look back to GE Moore; and assess some of the recent writings of A.D. Smith.(B) The Links between Sense Perception and ImaginationI want to return to an old theme from Hume concerning the relation between impressions and ideas and the so-called ‘Copy Principle’. In effect, Hume starts with a conception of there being a difference in kind between sense experience and other experiential episodes such as remembering and imagining, and then constructing an account which denies that there is any such difference. In the analytic tradition, Hume’s stance is endorsed almost universally. I want to explore the problems with Hume’s approach, and alternatives to this.We will be looking at work by Bernard Williams, Chris Peacocke, Zeno Vendler, David Velleman.© Emotions and Feelings of EmotionPhilosophical theories of emotion have tended to focus on the opposition between identifying emotion with feelings or with judgement. Recent popular accounts have led others to suppose that emotional states are forms of perception.In contrast, I want to suggest that we should look at the idea that emotional states are not themselves part of the stream of consciousness, and that we need to mark a fundamental distinction between emotions and feelings of emotion. This leads us instead to question how one should identify and individuate the feelings of emotion.We will be looking at work by Gilbert Ryle, Richard Wollheim, Malcolm Budd, Jesse Prinz.(D) Pain, Affect and EvaluationThe paradigm example of a simple phenomenal quality in many philosophical discussions is that of feeling pain. I want to explore the idea that pain is not a simple feeling or quality, and that we can understand what pain is only in the context of its psychological and biological function without thereby eliminating the phenomenal aspect of these episodes.We will be looking at work by Nikola Grahek and Valerie Grey Hardcastle.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course serves as an introduction to philosophical thinking by focusing in particular on philosophical questions concerning minds. We will attempt to better understand what it is involved in being an animal with mental states. Some of the questions we will be thinking about include the following: What are mental states? In what way do we know about the minds of other people? How do we know what we are thinking? What are unconscious mental states? We will also consider some philosophical questions about specific kinds of mental states including wanting, believing, feeling pain, and loving.Previously taught:

poorly; peopleís arguments are good or bad. Logic is concerned with
telling the difference; specifically, we will look at formal systems for
characterizing and evaluating the structure of a particular kind of
argument, deductive arguments. A good, or valid, deductive argument is one
in which the conclusion follows from the premisesóone in which true
premises would guarantee a true conclusion. Our study of formal systems
will yield methods for figuring out when arguments are valid.This class is in many ways like a math class: the work will primarily

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe purpose of this course is to provide an
   introduction to modern philosophy, roughly the period of philosophical
   work spanning from 1550-1850. One of our primary aims will be to learn
   about the kind of understanding of the world, human beings, and their
   place in it that some of the great philosophers of the period aspired to
   in light of the scientific developments of their time. In particular, we
   will focus on philosophical views about knowledge, thought, and self. We
   will begin by looking at some medieval thinkers, Avicenna and Aquinas,
   and continue on into the modern period proper with Descartes, Hobbes,
   Spinoza, Locke, Hume, and RousseauPreviously taught:

Is our knowledge built on a foundation or are we floating on a raft, or does our knowledge have the structure of a teepee? What are the requirements for knowledge? How much do we need to trust others in order to know? Can we trust ourselves? Do animals have knowledge?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will compare and contrast the Greek, Medieval and Modern worlds as expressed in their greatest literature. We will follow in detail how in the West polytheism gradually became more and more monolithic until everything was understood in relation to a single God, and then how this synthesis fell apart and left our culture with a choice between nihilism or a return to polytheism.  The goal of the course is both to illustrate how to read difficult texts and to provide an understanding of the cultural paradigms that have formed and focused our shared beliefs and practices.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaLogic is about reasoning, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and how to tell the difference between good and bad reasoning.In this course, we will develop techniques for laying bare the structure of arguments (“reasonings”). This will enable us then to characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These three things — a conception of structure of arguments, a precise characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning — constitute a “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a conclusion.Textbook: Modern Logic by Graeme Forbes, Oxford University Press, 1994.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA common, if tacit, assumption in much political philosophy is that the normative framework of philosophical questions about the political are autonomous of the more specific practical questions addressed in moral philosophy. As a consequence, political philosophers tend to focus on questions of political obligation, property, legitimacy, community and liberty independent of the grounding of these problems in a broader ethical context. Historically, this divorce of the political from the moral is eccentric – the great writers of the Enlightenment addressed political questions all as part of a broader theory of morals. In this seminar I want to return to this older tradition, and address political issues only through more fundamental ethical concerns, without assuming that such notions as political obligation have a clear understanding or a fundamental role in exploring issues.The seminar divides into three broad elements:First: Defining Problems. 
I want to raise questions about the distinctive content of political philosophy by looking at the import of the shift from comprehensive to political liberalism in the work of Rawls. This is often interpreted as a form of retreat on Rawls’s part from a more wholehearted liberalism in the face of a multicultural or relativistic challenge. An alternative reading sees the shift in Rawls as an attempt to be more exact in the commitments that a properly liberal framework should take in political debate. In contrasting these interpretations, we will be drawn back to some earlier problems and concerns within the history of political philosophy. Rousseau occupies a distinctive position within the Enlightenment tradition, not, as sometimes popularly portrayed, for offering an excuse for revolutionary zeal and offering an ostensible rationale for totalitarian impulses in the name of liberty, but because he offers us a distinctive alternative conception of contractualism and the questions that are to be posed or answered in a political theory from the dominant tradition tracing through from Hobbes and Locke to contemporary discussion. We can see Rawls’s liberalism, consistently espoused and maintained in his political liberalism, as tracing back to the Rousseauian tradition.Second: Foundational Themes. 
I want to look at some very broad questions about the nature of value and practical reason in order to address questions of how social concerns bear on us individually and provide justification for the social constraints and demands on us.What seems quite intuitive to many of us is that others can quite properly make demands on us that their needs should be met, and that we in turn can expect and demand that our needs should also be met by others. At the same time, we recognise that there are limits both to the demands we can make on others and that they can make on us. It would be unreasonable for one to make excessive demands on others, and reasonable for us to reject excessive demands of others on us. Early utilitarian thought is attractive in the emphasis it places on the idea that there are moral requirements to meet the needs of others; and historically this had a radical political influence. However, utilitarianism is widely taken to fail as a philosophical account of the political sphere because the associated consequentialist conception both of value and of practical reason fails properly to capture the limits that the demands of others can make on individuals. This raises the question whether any other approach can answer to the intuitive elements of early utilitarianism while better respecting the idea that there are limits on the demands that can be placed on an individual. One way of thinking of recent contractualist theories of ethical and political thought is that they attempt to do just that.We shall address the question whether there is a distinctively contractualist approach to these social concerns which starts out from the needs of others but seeks to respect the limits on claims of need, by looking at a series of issues. First, questions of how the sheer number of people involved in a given claim can make a difference to what one is rationally or morally required to do. Many philosophers who reject consequentialism still hold that the number of people or claims involved has a direct bearing on what one should do. Is this supposition really so obvious? We shall then look to questions about equality and the question whether equality or fairness are themselves things of intrinsic value which we are required to pursue in our lives. Intrinsic egalitarians claim that a just society should be organised to engage with and further these values. In contrast, we shall see a needs-based account can explain the political appeal of claims of equality without having to suppose the existence of such values.This still raises a question about the existence and fostering of distinctively social goods provided by social institutions which claim resources from us that otherwise could be used for meeting needs. How are we to understand how the needs of individuals are to be balanced against the fostering of such goods as universities, museums, public art.Third: Sample Problems. I want to address some specific examples of questions of general political concern within the framework we have developed. I want to raise some questions of general concern about individual liberty and communal demands on us, familiar from general political debate but under-discussed within philosophical debate. In particular:a.)  The family. Most politicians make voter capital through claiming to protect and foster families and family life. Should a just society tolerate the institution of the family? Sociological evidence indicates that historical inequalities, advantages and disadvantages are passed on through family structure. Can the institution of the family be tolerated or justified within an individualistic perspective?b.)  Sexual Politics and the Market. Most Western societies regulate market transactions involving sexual behaviour. What justifies such restriction? Is there any particular area of human behaviour which should be removed from and preserved from economic transaction? Is there a special role or understanding of self-ownership which explains the distinctive attitude towards market transactions involving one’s own body?c.)  Charities and begging. Most Western societies regulate and restrict individual begging while encouraging and providing benefits to charitable organizations. Is it preferable for societies to prefer charitable activity over central taxation?Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course you will be introduced to philosophy by engaging with the
ideas and arguments of the three most important ancient Greek philosophers:
Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. They will help us consider how we should be
living our lives, what justice is, how we can acquire knowledge, what
knowledge is, what one gains from asking “what is it?” questions, what
change is, whether we can understand anything in the natural world, and a
host of other philosophical questions that were deeply influential on the
rest of western philosophy. Along the way, you’ll work on the following
skills: making and understanding arguments and objections, reading difficult
texts carefully, and writing clearly and precisely about philosophy. You
will be learning to do philosophy by engaging with its foundational works.Previously taught:

It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy.  Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills.  There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading.  In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper.  This term, the readings will focus on problems related to free will.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe single most important question in philosophy ? and in intellectual
life generally ? at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we
reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious,
free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human
beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical
particles?
This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the
nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused
by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How
do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is
the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free
will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our
free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves
as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How
exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of
social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments?
This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental
questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and
psychology.R Searle, J. Intentionality Cambridge 0-521273021

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein. We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege and Russell.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHow does human society differ from that of other social animals? How is it possible that there can be an objective reality of such things as money, property, government, marriage, and universities, even though such things exist only because we believe they exist? What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The
course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the
differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail?

Contemporary philosophy is steeped in logic: to read journal articles and take part in discussions, one needs to know a certain amount of logic. We will study i) the basic techniques of logic, including syntax, semantics, proof theory, metalogic, and a bit of philosophy of logic; and ii) a number of extensions of standard logic that are important in philosophy (for example, intuitionist logic, modal logic, counterfactuals). The course will be more broad than deep: we will examine many different systems, but will not spend a lot of time proving difficult metalogical results about these systems (except for completeness in propositional modal logic.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe Posterior Analytics builds on Aristotle’s logic as developed in the Prior Analytics by 
focusing on demonstrative proofs.  But Aristotle is here no longer concerned with the structure of proofs, rather than with the conditions of proof.  There is therefore little use made of the theory of the syllogism, instead Aristotle discusses the starting points of all sciences: 
definitions, existential assumptions, general axioms.  Thus the Posterior Analytics contains Aristotle’s philosophy of science because he is sorting out the different kinds of starting points and points out the various problems of ascertaining them.   Given the density and complexity of the text the seminar will not cover the entire work, but focus on what is most important about the Aristotelian conception of an exact science.  For readers of Greek there will be an extra hour of study of the Greek text.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California*open only to philosophy GSIsHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe seminar will be concerned primarily with the part of the book dealing with Kant’s aesthetics, and more specifically his theory of the beautiful.  We’ll be trying to understand the theory in its own right, but also its connections to Kant’s broader epistemological project, and in particular to his theory of judgment as it applies in theoretical knowledge.  If time permits, and depending on the interests of the participants, we’ll also look at some of Kant’s theory of biological teleology.  The readings will primarily be drawn from the book itself, but we will also be reading extracts of Henry Allison’s 2001 book, “Kant’s Theory of Taste”, and some articles by the instructor.   We’ll be using the translation by Guyer and Matthews (Cambridge, 2000).   Participants should have some prior acquaintance with Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason”.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe focus of this graduate seminar is the nature of depiction and the experience of pictures. What do you see when you look at a picture? What is a picture? And what makes some pictures works of art? Pictures introduce the problem of intentionality, so an underlying project of the seminar is to understand and explain intentionality. A further guiding concern is the value of art, and art criticism, for philosophy (as philosophy). We will also consider the question of dance (what do you see when you look at a dance?).Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaOur belief-forming processes are fallible; even in our best epistemic states we still might be wrong. Fallibilism reassures us that our imperfect reliability doesn’t mean that any belief is as good as any other. Nevertheless, there are three areas of discussion where this point is not fully observed: the pessimistic induction over the history of science, worries about the use of fallible testimony and fallible jurors in the courtroom, and the debate over Intelligent Design “theory” in the public schools. This is because we do not fully understand how to take our fallibility into account. In this seminar, we discuss fallibilism and a proposal for a new rationality constraint, and apply these ideas to the debates above.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe can use language in thinking and talking about the world.  What makes this possible is that the signs of language have meaning.  How is it that individual words and phrases can be used to identify particular objects?  What is the role of consciousness in making it possible for us to think about our surroundings?Ordinary physical objects, collections of atoms and molecules, do not generally have the ability to represent other objects, or to refer to them.  What is it about humans that makes it possible for us to represent our surroundings, to refer to the objects around us?  Can we make sense of the idea that non-human animals might be able to represent their surroundings, and refer to the objects around them?We will begin by looking at Frege’s classical analysis of reference to objects, and the puzzle Frege articulated about the possibility of their being different ways of referring to the same object.  We will go on to look at Kripke’s analysis of reference, and the way in which later theorists have developed his approach into a view of meaning as a biological phenomenon.  Finally, we will look at the radically different approach proposed by the later Wittgenstein, and at the response to Wittgenstein suggested by Russell’s work on consciousness as acquaintance with one’s surroundings.Previously taught:

This will also involve examining Heidegger’s complex views on technology and its role in our modern world.The essay collections Poetry, Language, Thought and Elucidations of Hölderlin’s Poetry by Martin Heidegger have been ordered for the course. A few additional texts will be made available later in a reader or on b-space.Enrollment is limited to 20 (by application only). Preference will be given to Philosophy majors or those who have already taken a course on Heidegger.To apply to enroll students should submit a brief statement (less than a page long) to the instructors via email (dreyfus@berkeley.edu and kuk@berkeley.edu) by May 27th, explaining their interest in this seminar and their background in philosophy.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat are the constraints on rational preferences?  This course will consider
various answers and approaches to this question within decision theory.
In decision theory, the question of what it is rational to prefer or decide
is tied up both with what it is rational to believe and with what it is
rational to desire.  The first section of the course will examine proposed
constraints on beliefs, desires, and preferences at a time by a single
individual.  We will examine standard decision theory and its axioms, as
well as various ways to argue for these axioms.  We will also examine
significant challenges to the theory.  The second section of the course will
consider constraints on preferences, beliefs, and desires across time,
including both forward-looking constraints, such as “reflection principles,”
and backwards-looking constraints, such as following through on commitments;
and related puzzles.  The third section of the course will consider
constraints across persons.  We will consider whether the existence of
disagreement - with a peer, or with one’s counterfactual self - should
compel a rational epistemic agent to change her beliefs.  Finally, we will
examine what, if any, relations there are among problems of decision making
across time, across persons, and across possible worlds.This course is intended for graduate students in philosophy; no background
in decision theory or formal epistemology is required.  One of my goals in
teaching this course is to introduce “newcomers” to the subject.  I will
simplify the technical material for easier accessibility, but students
wishing to go more in depth will have the opportunity.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics. We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will explore topics in the philosophy of art.  What is  art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a  picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is  performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about  human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to  answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and  related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th  century).Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology  entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by  Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.This course is an upper division philosophy course. it is intended for  students with some background in philosophy. Students with knowledge  of the arts are welcome, space permitting, provided they are motivated  to do philosophy.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will examine some of the basic concepts of politics and specifically the concept of the political.  This concern is motivated by the thought that our traditional understanding of politics (going ultimately back to Plato and Aristotle) has come or is coming apart.  In the middle section of the course attention will be focused on the work of Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, and Michel Foucault and their attempts to re-conceptualize the field of politics.  The final third of the course will consider how questions concerning technology, terrorism, globalization, and the environment affect the way we need to think about politics.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will be organized around various attempts to reinterpret the Judeo/Christian God, and to determine in what sense, if at all, such a God is still a living God.  We will study Dostoyevsky’s and Kierkegaard’s attempts to preserve a non-theological version of the God of Christianity, as well as Nietzche’s attempt to save us from belief in any version of God offered by our tradition.  We will view and discuss three films that deal with related issues.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA wide-ranging lecture-and-discussion course on the nature and prospects of metaphysics as the investigation of the necessary conditions of the possibility of thought and experience.  Can some such conditions be discovered, and can metaphysical conclusions about reality be drawn from them?  Particular topics to be explored in this way include: the problem of metaphysics; the project of Kantian or “transcendental” metaphysics; the independent reality of the colors of objects; the independent reality of causation; agency and the independent reality of values; the prospects of metaphysical satisfaction.
Familiarity with the history of modern philosophy, especially the philosophy of Hume and of Kant, is strongly recommended.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will study the development of Plato’s theory of Forms from its first traces in some earlier dialogues to its explanation his middle years and possible revisions in his work.  The examination will also include questions of the development in Plato’s theory of knowledge and the methods he uses in the discussion of the theory of Forms.  The focus will be on the central passages for this topic in Plato’s Euthyphro, Meno, Phaedo, Republic, Symposium, Phaedrus, Parmenides, Sophist and the Philebus.Required:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will make a close study of  Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy, aiming to understand his new conception of the nature of the human mind and its relation to the world.  We will consider his use of skepticism and the arguments for overcoming it.  We will study his account of ideas and their objects that formed the starting point for subsequent theories of mind and knowledge.  Special attention will be given, on the one hand,  to his argument that the nature of mind is wholly distinct from that of body, and, on the other, to his account of the human being as a real union of an autonomous thinking self and an extended mechanistically moving body. We will reflect on the tensions in Descartes’s dualism and various ways of addressing them. We will also look at the context of the Meditations, reading excerpts from other texts, e.g.,The  Objections and Replies, The Principles of Philosophy, The Passions of the Soul, and selections in a Course Reader.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThere will be three components to the seminar:  (1)  The nature of causation and the idea of a ‘level’ of explanation.  Here we will look in particular at the interventionist model of causation advocated by, among others, Woodward and Hitchcock.  (2)  Causation as it applies to mental states.  In particular, we will consider the analysis of perception, and whether it makes a difference to the causal role of perception that perceptual states are often conscious.  This will mean looking at various models of the content of conscious perception.  (3)  The role of rationality in an analysis of mental causation.  Here we will look at mental causation in psychiatry, and whether there is a place for an assumption of rationality in cases of, for example, delusion.  We will also look at the view of thinking as a motor process.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will work our way through Plato’s Phaedo, covering most
topics in it and trying to get an overall understanding of the dialogue.
Although only around 60 pages long, the Phaedo covers an incredibly wide
range of topics. If Plato’s Meno looks like his first transition from
ethical topics to epistemological ones, the Phaedo looks like his first
transition from ethical topics to metaphysical ones: the nature of
opposites, change, the forms, the sensible world, souls, and causation. The
dialogue is framed by ethical questions which are sometimes given
short-shrift in the secondary literature, but which I want us to discuss:
should we fear death? Is it acceptable to commit suicide? Are our body and
soul somehow at odds with one another? These ethical questions are connected
to the metaphysical and epistemological issues through the main topic of the
dialogue: four arguments for the immortality of the soul. In addition to the
topics already mentioned, Plato develops the idea that all learning is
recollection, which he had introduced in the Meno, and he provides a long
myth at the end of the dialogue, which provides an overall cosmological
picture of the universe.In addition to reading the Phaedo very closely, we will be reading secondary
literature, parts of other relevant dialogues, and other ancient
philosophers (particularly Anaxagoras, who seems to have a very strong
influence on the Phaedo).If you have not read any Plato before this class, I strongly suggest reading
the Euthyphro (one of Plato’s earlier, Socratic works) before the course
begins. I also strongly encourage you to read through the entire Phaedo once
before the course begins.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this seminar we will investigate how we might make sense of the
idea that truth is relative, and how we might use this idea to give
satisfying accounts of parts of our thought and talk that have
resisted traditional methods of analysis. Although there is a
substantial philosophical literature on relativism about truth,
this literature (both pro and con) has tended to focus on refutations
of the doctrine, or refutations of these refutations, at the expense of
saying clearly what the doctrine is. The approach here will be to try
to give a clear account of the view, and then to use the view to solve
some problems that have concerned philosophers and semanticists. The
main aim is to put relativist solutions to these problems on the table,
so that they may be compared with non-relativist solutions and accepted
or rejected on their merits.The main text of the seminar will be a book manuscript I am working
on, entitled
Assessment Sensitivity: Relative Truth and Its Applications. We
will tentatively aim to get through about one chapter each week,
with the aim of covering much, though not all, of the book. (Some
chapters still need to be written!) Each week there will also be
quite a bit of supplemental reading by other philosophers.The book falls into three main parts, and so will the seminar. In
the first part, we will consider how a relativist view might be
motivated, by reviewing the difficulties faced by various
non-relativist views about the meanings of words like “tasty.” We
will also survey some of the standard objections to relativism
about truth, with a view to clarifying a relativist’s philosophical
obligations. In the second part, we will attempt to give a clear
statement of the truth relativist position and try to make some
philosophical sense of it. In the third part, we will consider how
the machinery developed in the second part can be applied to some
real problems in semantics and philosophy (involving future
contingents, knowledge attributions, epistemic and deontic modals,
and indicative conditionals). If time permits, we may also consider
how the view I am developing compares with other views in the
vicinity.This seminar is intended primarily for Berkeley graduate students
in philosophy and in logic and the methodology of science. Others
should seek my permission before enrolling in the course.
A background in
philosophy of language, with some exposure to truth-conditional
semantics, will be helpful, though I will try to make the seminar
as accessible as possible to those who need to catch up in this
area.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will cover a variety of topics under the general headings in its title. I want to begin by looking at the problem of disjunctivism and we will start with Tyler Burge’s article on the subject. When we finish with disjunctivism, I want to reexamine the issue of collective intentionality in light of some recent criticisms of my views on the subject. These discussion will then lead in one of or both of two directions: one about perception and one about language. Right now I do not have in focus what exactly I want to cover, but these are the general directions in which I am moving. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is intended to introduce the student to the concepts and principles of deductive logic:  symbolizing English language sentences and arguments in terms of formalized languages; validity, implication, and equivalence in truth-functional and quantificational logic; systems of deduction, and their soundness and completeness.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn investigation not of perception or of knowledge in general but of the nature and “proper objects” of perception understood as a source of knowledge.  The main idea to be explored is that our knowing things about the world around us by perception can be satisfactorily explained only if we can be understood to sometimes perceive that such-and-such is so, where what we perceive to be so is the very state of the world that we thereby know to be so.  Central to the possibility of perceptual knowledge understood in this way is the distinction between perceiving an object x and perceiving that p.  The goal of the seminar is a better understanding of the conditions of this ‘propositional’ perception and its implications for a satisfactory explanation of perceptual knowledge of the world. Readings will be drawn from recent works of Brewer, Burge, Campbell, Cassam, Dretske, McDowell, and others.  I do not now have a fixed syllabus in mind.  I envisage broad-ranging, open-ended discussions of these issues and of whatever related lines of thought are of most interest to the participants.  Those in attendance will be expected to participate.  If you have in mind specific readings you would like the seminar to discuss, or if you would like to present something of your own within this range of questions, please let me know.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIt is a common thought that persons are profoundly valuable, and that their inherent value is an important desideratum for morality (perhaps the important desideratum).  But what exactly is it to ascribe value to persons?  How, more specifically, should the acknowledgement of the value of a person constrain or shape our deliberations about actions that might affect the person’s life in some way?  This seminar will examine some recent work in moral philosophy that centers on these issues, paying attention in particular to questions about our attitudes toward persons who do not (yet) exist.  Readings will include texts by Derek Parfit, T. M. Scanlon, Seana Shiffrin, David Velleman, and others.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will look at the views of a number of philosophers, especially Kant, on the question of what consciousness or self-consciousness adds to representations. Other philosophers we will examine are Descartes, Arnauld, Malebranche, Locke, and Leibniz. We will focus on the clarity and distinctness of a representation, and we will consider how they relate to conceptualization and judgment, and to self-consciousness. This will put us in a position to better understand Kant’s idea that the unity of consciousness makes possible the unity of a complex representation.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is a course in general philosophy of science. We study five topics of central importance where formal probabilistic approaches have brought progress. We ask: What makes something a scientific explanation?, What is required for observations to confirm (support) a hypothesis?, Is simplicity a guide to truth?, What is special about predicting novel data as opposed to accommodation of old data?, and Does the success of science give us reason to believe its theories are true? Topics covered include the problem of induction, some paradoxes of confirmation, and the advantages and disadvantages of Bayesianism. Prerequisite: one course in philosophy.Previously taught:

primarily from the Western philosophical tradition.  For example, does God
exist?  Should we believe in God?  Are there such things as souls, and if
so, how do they interact with the physical body?  How should a just God
punish us for our moral wrongdoing?  Finally, is morality based on God’s
commands?  The course material will be arranged topically, rather than
historically, and will be divided into four sections: arguments for and
against the existence of God, epistemology, metaphysics, and morality.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course deals with applications of game theory and rational choice
theory to philosophical problems, as well as with paradoxes and problems
introduced by these theories.  After introducing the basic concepts of game
theory, the first part of the course will be devoted to problems of
cooperation and convention: how people manage to coordinate their actions
for mutual benefit, e.g. drive on the same side of the road, carry out a
project together, or use language.  The next section will explore
non-cooperative games, such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma; the possible
application of these games to moral problems; and the need for and execution
of a social contract.  Finally, we turn to problems dealing with groups,
such as the problem of collective action, and some issues in group decision
making.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to moral and political philosophy.  Rather
than treating these as largely distinct areas of inquiry that answer
fundamentally different questions, we will approach questions in this
course in part by considering how our answers to some questions might
impact our answers to others.  After beginning by looking at several views
about the nature of morality, we will examine various positions on the
extent to which morality can make demands on individuals, including
thinking about how morality?s demands might be limited by considerations
of fairness, integrity, and the importance of personal projects.  We will
then consider two prominent views of justice, defended by Rawls and Nozick
respectively, and look at how each argues against the view of justice
defended by the other.  We will conclude by examining the ways in which
principles of justice and the demands of morality on individuals might
intersect, and the ways in which our intuitions about different questions
might lead us to hold views that are incompatible.  Attempting to resolve
this conflict and other similar conflicts will be a major theme of the
course.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to the philosophical study of the mind.  What is the mind?  Are our mental states, like beliefs and desires, states of our brains?  Are they states of some non-physical substance?  Or are they nothing more than tendencies to behave in certain ways?  Could a computer have a mind?  What is consciousness?  Is the nature of our conscious experiences entirely determined by our brain states?  Why is the study of consciousness so difficult?  Can there be a ?science? of consciousness?  When you have a belief about the President, what makes it the case that your belief is about that particular person?  Philosophers have argued for a variety of answers to these questions.  We will examine and evaluate those answers and arguments, and attempt to gain an understanding of the relation between the physical world and our minds.  Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat is it for an argument to be deductively valid? Intuitively, what’s
required is that the conclusion “follow from” the premises, or that the
truth of the premises “guarantee” the truth of the conclusion.  In this
course we will look at how to make this intuitive notion of validity
more precise.  We will learn how to represent the logical form of
English arguments in increasingly more fine-grained ways, and how to use
semantic and syntactic methods to demonstrate the validity of arguments
given such formal representations.  Upon completing the course, students
can expect to be familiar with the basic concepts of symbolic logic and
to be in a better position to formulate and evaluate arguments in
natural languages like English.Textbook: Modern Logic by Graeme Forbes, Oxford University Press, 1994.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis intensive 6-week course is an introduction to the philosophy of
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, as well as an introduction to doing
philosophy.  Our aim will be to understand the views and arguments of
these philosophers, and to engage critically with them.  This will require
close reading of the ancient texts, and thoughtful discussion of the
issues they raise.  Some of the ideas we discuss will be surprisingly
familiar, some of them strikingly alien to our usual ways of thinking.  In
studying and assessing these ideas, we will be asking not only what, if
anything, justifies the ancient philosophers’ views, but also what, if
anything, justifies our own views.
The questions we will discuss include: What is the difference between
knowledge and belief?  What are definitions?  Must someone who understands
a notion be able to define it?  What is the connection between virtue and
knowledge?  How is it possible to be weak willed?  Is breaking the law
ever morally justifiable?  What is the connection between morality and
being human?
Students will be required to write three short papers, contribute to
in-class discussion, and sit a final exam.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPhilosophy during the 17th and 18th centuries was shaped largely in
response to revolutionary new developments in the natural sciences–the
so-called Scientific Revolution.   The aim of this course is to give an
introductory survey to some of the most important philosophical writings
from this modern period.   We will read texts by Descartes, Locke,
Berkeley, Leibniz, Hume and Kant.  The philosophical topics to be covered
include the nature of reality, the existence of God, the relation between
mind and body, and the possibility of knowing anything about the world
around us.  The views offered by the philosophers we will be studying have
strongly influenced all philosophical thinking to come after this period. Thus, in addition, to learning about the historical context of these
works, we will also be critically engaging and assessing the plausibility
of the philosophical arguments in their own right.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPhenomenology was – besides analytic philosophy – one of the two great philosophical movements of the 20th century. It has been praised for addressing topics more relevant to real people’s life, but blamed for relatively lower standards of clarity and for non-delivering its over-ambitious goals. It has been more influential than analytic philosophy outside of academic philosophy (and is thus important in many areas of humanities and cultural studies). Within philosophy, there have been repeated attempts to merge life-relevance of phenomenology with clarity and modesty of analysis.In this course, we shall focus on close reading and critical explanation of selections from three classical books of the movement, Edmund Husserl’s Cartesian Meditations (1929) and Crisis of European Sciences (1936) and Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception (1945). The Cartesian Meditations are the best introduction to Husserl’s phenomenology, in the Crisis he adds influential material about the life-world, about science, and about history. In the Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty merges motives from Husserl and Heidegger with stuff from psychology and psychopathology and sketches his own conception of philosophy.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course serves as an introduction to philosophy through a number of
central issues in moral philosophy.  We will consider whether moral claims
are objectively true in the sense that individual people can be mistaken
about what is morally right and wrong.  We will also analyze a few
prominent views of what makes actions right and wrong.  In light of these
views, we will take up some questions in political philosophy, such as
whether the state is justified in punishing its citizens and how resources
should be distributed in society.  Readings for the course will be drawn
from both classic and contemporary sources.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to philosophy
 by doing philosophy of mind. We will begin by taking up the
 traditional question: What kind of thing is the mind? In connection
 with this question, we will engage with philosophers who think of the
 contents of the mind, things such as ideas, perceptions, beliefs,
 dreams, and imaginings, as something like pictures. We will focus on
 dreams in particular. From there, we will move on to an enormous
 question in the philosophy of mind which brings together a number of
 fascinating issues: Are human beings free? And if so, to what extent
 are they free and in what areas of our mental life does our freedom
 lie? In connection with this question, we will look at some writings
 in psychoanalysis and spend some time thinking about one particularly
 important domain of our freedom, namely: love. Throughout the course,
 we will learn how to read, think, speak, and write critically and with
 great precision and rigor.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will begin this introductory course in epistemology with the question
of whether we really know what we ordinarily think we know, and the
worrisome view that we really do not: skepticism. We will focus in this
regard on the following questions. The skeptic seems to demand from us
some kind of explanation of how we know the things we think we know. What
kind of demand is this and how does the skeptic raise it? Is it a
reasonable demand – must we meet it? And even if we don’t need to, how
does one say what is so compelling about such a demand? We may also touch
on further, but related questions about the relation between belief,
truth, and justification, and about how we ought to go about believing
things.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn examination of central issues in early modern philosophy by way
   of texts by Rene Descartes, John Locke, Julien Offray de La Mettrie,
   George Berkeley, David Hume, Thomas Reid, and (very briefly)
   Immanuel Kant. Topics covered will include: skepticism and
   knowledge; matter and the soul; perception, thought, and personal
   identity; and the nature of moral judgment. Of particular interest
   will be the rise of philosophical naturalism, and the question of
   how the modern scientific understanding of nature impacts

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaDo humans possess an innate moral faculty that evolved to meet certain adaptive challenges? Is the innate equipment a single faculty or does the moral mind consist of several distinct modules, e.g., one for compassion, one for justice, and so on?   Is the moral mind well-designed to meet the adaptive challenges modern people face? We will examine two distinct literatures to answer this question: (1) comparative work in philosophical anthropology, examining Greek, Chinese, Buddhist ethics; (2) recent work at the intersection of moral philosophy, psychology, and evolutionary biology.Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics (Hackett)

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicates the intuitive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’) and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’). In addition, we will also develop techniques for showing when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus. Textbook: J. Barwise, J.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy—and, for
the uninitiated, to philosophy itself. We will spend almost all of
our time on the three most important Greek philosophers—Socrates,
Plato, and Aristotle—with a passing glance at pre-Socratic and
Hellenistic philosophers. Our primary goal will be to understand these
philosophers’ characteristic methods and views, and (more importantly)
their reasons for holding these views. It is often said that we should
study ancient Greek philosophy because it is the intellectual basis
for all later western philosophy and natural science. That is true,
but it is only half the story. We should also study ancient Greek
philosophy to become familiar with a worldview so alien that it throws
our own into sharp relief. As you are outraged by some of the things
these philosophers say, you will come to see more clearly what your
own views are, and you will be forced to ask what justifies them. You
will not just be studying the history of philosophy; you will be doing
philosophy. Prerequisite: None.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy.  We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as some influential work by contemporary philosophers (including Korsgaard, Nagel, Scanlon, and Williams).  Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)?  Why should we care about complying with moral demands?  What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)?  Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn upper-division course on the philosophical theory of knowledge.  Not a general, encyclopedic survey of the field, but an investigation and detailed discussion some of the central problems in the subject.  Knowledge of many different kinds is obviously fundamental to scientific, cultural, social, and personal life.  What is it about human perception, belief, and knowledge that makes it so difficult to find a philosophically satisfying general explanation of how human knowledge is possible?  And how are those obstacles to be overcome?We will spend about equal time on each of the three problems:How do we come to believe and know things that we do not 
        perceive to be so at the moment (e.g., the future)?What exactly do we perceive, and how does it give us 
        knowledge of the world around us at the moment?How does one person come to believe and know anything
        about what another person thinks and feels?Lectures and discussion sections will pursue these questions through close reading of assigned material in:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe main purpose of this course is to answer 
the question, “How does language relate to the world?” In order to do this we will have to explore a lot of related questions, such as those concerning the nature of truth, reference, meaning, speech acts, metaphors, fiction, and pictures. We will also try to develop a general theoretical account of how human linguistic behavior is related to the rest of human behavior 
and to human mental states.There are two parts to the course. In the first part, I will explain how I think language ought to be studied philosophically. The philosophy of language is a branch 
of the philosophy of mind. In the second part of the course, I will teach mainstream philosophy of language, and attempt both to explain and criticize it.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHow does human society differ from that of other social animals? How is it possible that there can be an objective reality of such things as money, property, government, marriage, and universities, even though such things exist only because we believe they exist? What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail? Are there human rights, and if so what are they and where do they come from?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSince its publication in 1927 Heidegger’s major work Being and Time has been many things to its various recipients.  Though the work has made major contributions to existential thought, hermeneutics, and post-structuralism its main concern is a revolution of what Heidegger regarded as the central term of philosophy since antiquity: the concept of being.  Because he viewed the traditional understanding of this concept as superficial and misguided, his plan was to work out a new fundamental ontology. Its design was (I) to reveal the true meaning of being on the basis of temporality as its transcendental horizon and (II) to point out the crucial missteps in the tradition (Aristotle, Descartes and Kant) that led to the misconception.  Heidegger never finished this ambitious project, but the work’s first part with its extensive analysis of human understanding as the basis of the conception of being was sufficient to make this work a major challenge to friend and foe alike.  The course will focus on the connection between the question of being, the analysis of human nature, and the phenomenological method that Heidegger presents as the necessary foundations of his project in Division I of Being and Time.
We will largely confine ourselves to the study of the difficult text itself (we will use the 1962 translation by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson, available as a paperback reprint of 2008 in the Harper Perennial Modern Thought series) but a reader with some additional material and secondary literature will also be prepared.  Participants are required to give one class presentation and to submit a research-paper of 15 pages at the end of the semester.The course will be taught in a seminar format. Enrollment is limited to 25 and is by application only. Although the seminar is open to graduate students preference will be given to junior and senior philosophy majors. To apply to enroll students should write to the instructors (dfrede@berkeley.edu and kuk@berkeley.edu) by May 24th and very briefly describe their background in philosophy and their interest in the course.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA wide-ranging lecture-and-discussion course on the nature and prospects of a Kantian or “transcendental” metaphysical investigation of the necessary conditions of the possibility of human thought and experience.  Can some such conditions be discovered, and can metaphysical conclusions about how the world is or must be drawn from them?  Particular topics to be explored in this setting include: the problem of metaphysics, the independence of physical objects, the objectivity of causal modality, mind and body, persons and first-person thought, self-consciousness and thought of an objective world, conditions of the attribution of psychological attitudes, agency and the attribution of value, perceptions of colour and the colours of objects.  Familiarity with the history of modern philosophy, especially the philosophy of Kant, is recommended.  Required course work includes extensive reading of sometimes difficult material and careful writing of focused critical papers.  Not for beginners in philosophy.A reader containing required and supplementary readings will be available.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar, co-taught with Tania Lombrozo (Psychology), will explore theoretical and empirical issues in the study of conceptual representation. In particular, we will consider contemporary work from philosophy and psychology, addressing issues such as: How are conceptual representations structured? How do they refer to the world? And how are they acquired? The seminar will be co-taught by a philosopher and a psychologist (and cross-listed in both departments), so the approach will be interdisciplinary and students are encouraged to have an interest and some background in both psychology and philosophy. Requirements will include active participation in class discussions as well as a final paper.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will start out by looking at joint attention and its role in linguistic communication.  Then we’ll move on to the phenomenon of attention itself and its relation to consciousness.  Finally, we’ll explicitly consider what kind of causal analysis to give of perceptual experience, given the roles that attention and consciousness play in perception.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe seminar will cover in detail some basic results in proof theory.
We  will use the original articles by Gerhard Gentzen (1909-1945), who
 founded both structural proof theory and ordinal proof theory. This
is  timely as this year many conferences have been organized to
celebrate  the centenary of Gentzen’s birth. In structural proof
theory we will  cover, among other things, the natural deduction
calculus, the sequent  calculus, cut-elimination and mid-sequent
theorem for the sequent  calculus, and various applications of such
results. In ordinal proof  theory we will study, among other things,
Gentzen’s consistency proof  for first-order Peano Arithmetic using
ordinal induction up to  epsilon-zero. In addition, we will also read
some other logical and  philosophical articles by Gentzen and some
secondary literature, where  appropriate. The seminar will be of
interest to philosophers, logicians,  computer scientists, linguists
and mathematicians. Through this  material, philosophy students will
acquire the tools required for  tackling further debates in philosophy
of mathematics (prospects for  Hilbert’s program and its relativized
versions etc.) and philosophy of  logic and language (meaning of the
logical constants; proof-theoretic  semantics; realism/anti-realism,
Dummett’s program (normalization,  harmony etc.)). Graduate students
in philosophy may use this course,  with previous agreement by the
head graduate adviser and myself, for  satisfying the formal
philosophy course requirement (i.e. a course in  the 140 series or
equivalent).The minimal requirement for taking the seminar is Philosophy 12A
(Introduction to Logic), although a certain amount of
logical/mathematical maturity (but no specific knowledge of advanced
mathematics) will be necessary for mastering the material.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat is the connection between consciousness, and more specifically sensory consciousness and the idea of mental content? “Content of consciousness” is a phrase often used in a manner which contrasts with “propositional/representational/mental content”. But some people have argued that it is obvious that states of mind which exemplify sensory consciousness have content in the second sense, and that one cannot suppose that there is any content of consciousness in the first sense without accepting that sensory states have such content in the second sense. In these seminars I want to start out by looking at some recent arguments for the centrality of propositional content in sense experience. But the aim is not to settle the question whether perceptual experiences have (propositional) content but to try and formulate the best terms in which anything might turn on this. In this context I want to look first at some slightly older discussions of representation and sense-data and then move back to the beginning of the twentieth century to look at some of Moore’s writings on sensory awareness, sense-data and our knowledge of the external world.Requirements:Students taking this course for credit will write a term paper due no later than one week after the last day of class.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will be organized around contractualist approaches in
contemporary political philosophy. The seminar will pursue three key
themes. First, authority: Is the principal concern of political theory
the authority of the state and the source of our obligations to obey
state institutions and its agents? If not, what should our principal
concerns in political philosophy be? Second, the weight of numbers:
Aren’t aggregative concerns intuitively compelling in certain social
policy contexts? Does that show that we must move beyond a pure
individualistic perspective to one in which consequential outcomes are
part of the measure of justice? Third, equality: Is equality or fairness
a political value in itself? In what sense can a position claim to be
egalitarian or guided by equality if it denies that equality has a
special value?In pursuing these questions we will consider writings by T. M. Scanlon,
John Rawls, Joseph Raz and G. A. Cohen, as well as some historical
texts. I will also distribute parts of the manuscript of a book I am
working on.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe topic of this seminar is art and human nature. What is art? Why do we value art as we do? What does art reveal about our nature? Drawing on philosophy, art history, and cognitive science, we will explore these questions. We will also look at recent efforts to frame problems about art in terms of neuroscience and evolutionary biology. Not only the pictorial but also the performing arts will concern us. This seminar is open to graduate students of philosophy. All other students require the permission of the instructor to attend.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will discuss Kant’s aesthetic theory, focussing primarily on his theory of the beautiful.  We will be concerned both with the theory in its own right, and with its broader philosophical implications.  Readings will be drawn mostly from the Critique of Judgment, with some background material (e.g. Hume) and some secondary readings.  The class will be conducted as a seminar, and participants will be required to participate actively in discussion.  Requirements will include several short writing assignments and a longer final paper.Enrollment in the class is limited to 15 and is by application only.  To apply to enroll, you should send an email  (with “Philosophy 187 application” in the subject line) to the instructor at ginsborg@berkeley.edu with a description of your reasons for wishing to take the course and a description of your background in philosophy, including, but not necessarily limited to, a list of philosophy courses already taken.  Participants will be expected to have a strong background in philosophy, preferably including a course on Kant (although this is not essential).  Preference will be given to philosophy majors.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will survey the basic questions of moral and political philosophy, as well as some classic attempts to answer them.  We will ask, among other things: What is the morally right thing for me to do?  Why should I do it?  Is there a fact of the matter what it is, or does it just depend on my feelings or upbringing?  Why should I do what the government tells me to?  Why should I tolerate alien moral beliefs and practices?

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of  psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical  world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism,  Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism,  Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the  mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and  hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they  configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental  states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to  the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states  of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its  potential for causal relations with other mental states and with  behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the  brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary  biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in  biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the  world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the  course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course addresses basic questions in the philosophy of religion,
primarily from the Western philosophical tradition.  For example, does God
exist?  Should we believe in God?  Are there such things as souls, and if
so, how do they interact with the physical body?  How should a just God
punish us for our moral wrongdoing?  Is morality based on God’s commands?
The course will deal primarily with contemporary readings, and material will
be arranged topically, rather than historically.  The course is divided into
four sections: arguments for and against the existence of God, epistemology,
metaphysics, and morality.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaLogic is about reasoning, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and how to tell the difference between good and bad reasoning.In this course, we will develop techniques for laying bare the structure of arguments (“reasonings”). This will enable us then to characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These three things — a conception of structure of arguments, a precise characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning — constitute a “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a conclusion.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is a course in general philosophy of science. We study five topics of central importance where formal probabilistic approaches have brought progress. We ask: What makes something a scientific explanation?, What is required for observations to confirm (support) a hypothesis?, Is simplicity a guide to truth?, What is special about predicting novel data as opposed to accommodation of old data?, and Does the success of science give us reason to believe its theories are true? Topics covered include the problem of induction, some paradoxes of confirmation, and the advantages and disadvantages of Bayesianism. Prerequisite: one course in philosophy.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments? This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course has two parts. Part One will be more technical in nature. It will involve learning some of the key metalogical results for first-order logic (e.g., soundness, completeness, and compactness). The goal will be to get through Parts 1–3 of Hunter’s “Metalogic” textbook, which concludes with a famous metalogical paradox called “Skolem’s Paradox”. Part Two will be more philosophical in nature. It will involve investigating the historical impact (on 20th century analytic philosophy) of the metalogical results covered in Part One of the course. For instance, we will discuss the influence of “Skolem’s Paradox” on the philosophical development of W.V.O. Quine and Hilary Putnam.Prerequisites. PHIL 12A, and willingness to engage both in mathematical and philosophical work.Textbook. Hunter, “Metalogic,” UC Press 1971. Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course provides a study of the main areas of Aristotle’s works in the fields of logic, meta-physics, natural science, psychology and ethics/politics.  It will end with a brief overview of his poetics and rhetoric. Aristotle was not only the first philosopher who systematized the dif-ferent disciplines of philosophy, but also worked out their basic principles and method.  The course’s main concern will therefore be a proper understanding of the interconnection between the principles, method and the results of Aristotle’s thought.  Given the wide scope of his in-terests, the course will have to confine itself to a selective study of his works.  Since these works are hard to access because of their terse style, the readings will focus in the main on an analysis of selected texts taken from (ed.) Richard McKeon, The Basic Works of Aristotle.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA four unit course on the philosophy of David Hume (1711–1776), dealing as thoroughly as possible in the time available with many of the central issues of his major works. Students will be expected to read carefully, to discuss, and to write clearly and perceptively about those works and the problems they raise. No specific prerequisites; completion of at least Philosophy 25B is strongly advised. The richer one’s background in philosophy and the more one reads and thinks and discusses with others, the more one will get from the course. A large body of secondary literature and commentary can be helpful, but the emphasis throughout will be on the words and ideas of Hume himself.Lectures will discuss primarily but not exclusively the following topics: Introduction-the science of human nature; Operations of the mind: the theory of impressions and ideas; The idea of causation and its source in experience; Belief and the sources of beliefs about the unobserved; The idea of necessary connection; The continued and distinct existence of objects; The self: the idea of personal identity; Paradox, sceptical despair and its cure; Action and its source in feeling or passion; Freedom and necessity; Morality and its sources: not derived from reason; Feeling, sentiment, and sympathy as the basis of morality; The origin and rationale of justice as an ‘artificial virtue’; The origin of government and the source of political obligation; The human point or goal of philosophy.Course requirements: Three lectures per week; Participation in one discussion section per week; Four five-page papers on selected topics; Final examination.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn introduction to the philosophy of logic and to philosophical applications of logic.  The bulk of the course will be devoted to discussion of two notions that play a central role in logical theory: truth and logical consequence.  We will pay special attention to the philosophical significance of Tarski’s formal definitions of both notions.  At the end of the course we will consider how logical theory can be brought to bear on philosophical problems, focusing on the sorites paradox (or “paradox of the heap”).  Topics to be covered include theories of truth, facts and propositions, the slingshot argument, Tarski’s truth definitions, objectual and substitutional quantification, proof-theoretic and model-theoretic definitions of logical consequence, relevance logics, dialetheism, the sorites paradox, many-valued logics, and supervaluations.Prerequisites:  Philosophy 12A (or equivalent) and at least one other course in philosophy.  The course covers some technical material, but knowledge of logic beyond what is taught in 12A will not be  presupposed.Requirements will include both papers and occasional problem sets.Books: John Etchemendy, The Concept of Logical Consequence (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1990); course reader.Previously taught:

contributed to the philosophical understanding of action. We will focus
 on the basic structures of everyday practical activity, various states of
absorption, mastery, and breakdown, and the role and limitations of
intentional content and practical reasoning. Readings mainly from
Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, McDowell, and Dreyfus, with attention
to related neo-Aristotelian and neo-Kantian views, time permitting.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAt its core, decision theory is a mathematical theory that
relates preference, belief, and desire.  This theory is used in a variety of
ways: to guide action, to explain and predict behavior, to normatively
assess choices, and to gain access to mental states.  However, before it can
be adequate for any of these purposes, its theoretical core needs to be
expanded upon.  In particular, the notions of preference, belief, and desire
all need to be interpreted.
This seminar explores foundational issues in decision theory.  In
particular, we will focus on debates surrounding the analysis of preference,
belief, and desire.  Topics include the relationship between preference and
behavior; the relationship between desire and reason; incommensurable
values; substantive theories of utility; whether degrees of belief can be
vague; and other issues.  In addition to their importance to decision
theory, these debates touch on issues in ethics, epistemology, and
philosophy of mind.Requirements: graduate status or permission of the instructor.  No
background in decision theory is required, but students should be
comfortable with technical material.  Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this seminar, we will cover various “hot topics” in contemporary epistemology.  The main focus/theme of the seminar will be on the (epistemic) normative status of logic and formal methods (e.g., the epistemic-normative role of deductive logic, and similar questions for various “inductive logical” frameworks).  Other topics will include the nature of evidence (e.g., is evidence factive and can there be “knowledge from falsehood”?), coherence requirements (e.g., is coherence a requirement of epistemic rationality?), and full vs partial belief as a foundation for epistemology (e.g., “probabilism” and other non-traditional frameworks for epistemology, as opposed to traditional “full belief” approaches).  We will have various guest presenters throughout the term, including Jim Joyce (Michigan), Jonathan Weisberg (Toronto), Matt Kotzen (UNC), and our own Roush, Kolodny, and Buchak.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis will be a seminar about consciousness. As well as being interested in first order questions about the nature of conscious experiences (we’ll focus on the implications and viability of the intentionalist program, and the relation between consciousness and accessibility) we will also be interested in two broad metatheoretical issues. First, to what extent is a systematic theory of the dependence of consciousness on the physical world possible? To address this, we’ll start with supervenience and the idea of experience-types having “neural correlates”, and then look at some different ways in which psychophysical dependence might (or might not) be more systematic than the existence of either of these relations alone implies. The second metatheoretical issue is this: is consciousness as intellectually and practically significant as is conventionally assumed, and (related to this) how many of the questions people typically ask about consciousness have determinate answers? We’ll explore a deflationary view that resembles the position that certain philosophers have taken in past about such concepts as personal identity and free will.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaOur standard ways of representing and attributing mental
states and speech acts involves two components, which Frege
called force and content. Believing that snow is white and
imagining that snow is white are attitudes that share a
content but differ in force; similarly, believing that snow
is white and believing that mud is red share a force but
differ in content. This approach gives us the efficiencies
of a division of labor. A single account of content can be
combined with accounts of various kinds of forces to yield
accounts of various kinds of attitudes and speech acts.We will focus on the question: What should we take contents
to be, given their roles in our psychological and linguistic
theories? The classic accounts given by Frege and Russell
take contents to be structured complexes of senses (on the
Fregean view) or objects and properties (on the Russellian
view). We will be primarily interested, however, in
unstructured conceptions, which take contents to be
functions from circumstances, possibilities, or conditions
to truth values.We will begin by looking at Stalnaker’s development of such
a conception in Inquiry. We will ask what motivates
Stalnaker’s conception of content, as against structured
alternatives, and what explanatory work it does. We will
then look at several objections to unstructured conceptions: The problem of logical omniscience.
Intuitively, one need not believe all of the necessary
consequences of one’s beliefs, but the unstructured
conception seems to entail that one does. Relatedly,
there are plausible psychological generalizations – for
example, that if one believes a conjunction, one must
believe both conjuncts, but need not believe all of
the necessary consequences of the conjunction – that it
seems cannot be stated in a framework that takes
contents to be unstructured.Aboutness.
Intuitively, beliefs are individuated in part by what
they are about (by their topics or subject matters),
but it is not clear how a notion of aboutness can be
defined that makes sense for unstructured propositions.Frege’s puzzle.
Intuitively, believing that Hesperus is visible is not
the same as believing that Phosphorus is visible, but on
an unstructured conception, the contents would seem to
be the same.De se attitudes.
Intuitively, I could be omniscient, in the sense of
knowing which world is actual, without knowing which
object in that world I am.  So standard unstructured
views do not seem to provide resources for describing
de se attitudes.Although some of these objections have been taken to
motivate structured theories of contents, we will be
particularly interested in seeing how unstructured theories
can evolve to meet them.  In addition to classic treatments
of these problems, we will look at some very recent (and in
some cases, future) work on them.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is a course about the use of probability in epistemology. Probability imports assumptions about and imposes constraints on any subject matter you use it to describe. Some of these constraints are well-known, but their implications are not always known or observed. In others it is an open question how much leeway probability allows. We discuss the fate of holism, foundationalism, introspective access, self-knowledge, and objects of belief under a probabilistic description. We consider the consequences of the globality of the P function and of extreme probabilities. Cases that are illuminating include the preface “paradox,” evidential support, re-calibration, justified belief, and the epistemology of logic. We discuss artifacts of representation and how to think about idealization in philosophy. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will discuss some of the latest work in the Philosophy of Mind and the Philosophy of Perception.  We will also Fodor’s attempt to revive the language of mind hypothesis along with recent attacks on the Innateness Hypothesis.  Given the current scene, we also need to discuss disjunctivism.

What does it take to have a thought that is true or false?  What is the relation between having a concept and having a capacity for judgement?  What is the role or significance of predication?  Can believing and other ‘propositional’ attitudes involving predication be understood as a person’s standing in a certain relation to certain objects?  If so, what relation?  What objects? If not, how is belief and the attribution of ‘propositional’ attitudes to others to be understood?  What metaphysical or epistemological consequences, if any, can be drawn from fulfillment of the necessary conditions of thought and of the attribution of attitudes?Readings from Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Geach, Quine, Evans, Strawson, Davidson and others, with additional secondary material.Those attending will be expected to contribute to the discussion.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThere has recently been a striking resurgence of interest in the approaches of Anscombe and Aristotle to issues of agency, action, and practical norms.  In this seminar we will look at some recent work in this vein.  A central issue will be the explanation of what Anscombe called practical knowledge: our non-observational knowledge of what we are doing when we act.  Other topics will include the character of action as a (teleological) process; the relation of intentions to action; the structure of practical justification; and the source of the norms to which action is answerable.  We will start by reading Michael Thompson’s Life and Action, and then move on to look at work by Sebastian Rödl, Kieran Setiya, David Velleman, Richard Moran, Doug Lavin (among others).  Participants are strongly encouraged to (re-)read Anscombe’s Intention before the seminar begins.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is an introduction to the classics of philosophy of mathematics with emphasis on the debates on the foundations of mathematics.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn the first part of this seminar (approximately 6 weeks) we will examine the Discourse on Metaphysics, Leibniz’s first systematic presentation of his mature metaphysical picture.  Central topics covered in this work include: the nature of substance, the containment theory of truth, the harmony between substances, necessary and contingent truth, efficient causes and teleology, activity and passivity, force and dynamical physics, the relation of mind and body.   As we make our way through the Discourse, we will supplement it by further readings from related works.  In the second part of the seminar (approximately 8 weeks) we will look at Leibniz’s early work, with an eye to understanding the stages through which his metaphysical views progressed and tracing the origins of the views presented in the Discourse.  In this second part we will take as a guide Christia Mercer’s book, Leibniz’s Metaphysics: Its Origin and Development .Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will read and discuss this important work by the British philosopher, David Hume (1711-1776), which critically considers some of the most common arguments for the existence of God.

Students will need to email the instructor at dmwarren@berkeley.edu to request permission to enroll in this seminar.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will survey some basic questions of moral and political philosophy, as
well as some influential attempts to answer them. The course consists of
two sections. In the first section, we are concerned with the authority
and the objectivity of morality. We will ask: Why should I care about what
morality tells me to do? Are there objective moral truths, or is what one
morally ought to do dependent on God, on one’s feelings, or on one’s
society? In the second section, we will consider what morality is all
about. Are we morally required to produce the best outcome? What is the
best outcome? Is there something wrong with thinking of morality as aimed
at producing the best outcome, and is there an alternative? Is being a
morally good agent compatible with pursuing personal projects and with
having deep relationships? We will relate these questions to concrete
political issues such as warfare, distributive justice, toleration of
alien practices, and respecting the majority vote in democratic states.Readings for the class will be drawn from both historical and contemporary
sources (among others, we will engage with the views of Plato, Aristotle,
Hobbes, Hume, and Kant). A course reader containing most of the texts will
be available in the week before classes start.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will examine responses to the threat of nihilism—that
is, the threat that life is meaningless—in works of philosophy,
literature, and film.  To do so, we will grapple with a number of
questions including: What is our relation to the divine?  How can life be
worth living after the death of God?  How can one live a meaningful life? 
What makes an individual person or life authentic?  What is the
significance of death?  We will read works by Schopenhauer, Dostoevsky,

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaLogic is about reasoning, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and how to tell the difference between good and bad reasoning.In this course, we will develop techniques for laying bare the structure of arguments (“reasonings”). This will enable us then to characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These three things — a conception of structure of arguments, a precise characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning — constitute a “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a conclusion.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is designed as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally, and ancient philosophy in particular.  Those new to philosophy will learn the landscape by reading and writing about knowledge, the nature of reality, psychology, and ethics as the ancients saw it.  The ancient perspective is an excellent starting point not just for its historical role in philosophy, but for its contrast to many of our modern instincts.  Those with experience in philosophy will get acquainted not just with the striking differences between ancient and modern thinkers, but with the very elements for which Socrates, Plato and Aristotle are considered the founders of Western philosophy.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will focus on a close reading of Descartes’ most important work: his Meditations.  We will, however, begin with readings from the earlier Discourse and occasionally draw upon his other works and extensive correspondence.  Topics will include skepticism and our knowledge of our self, God and the world, the mind and its relation to the body, the roles of the senses and the intellect, and the relation between Descartes’ scientific and philosophical projects.  We will also take up some of the more specific issues for which Descartes’ discussion was to frame later philosophical debates, e.g., perception and the theory of ideas, the distinction between primary and secondary qualities, and the nature of space.  Depending upon time and interest, we may close by considering interpretive debates surrounding Descartes among his successor “Cartesians,” especially the vitriolic exchange between Malebranche and Arnauld.READINGS:

We will examine the metaphysical and epistemological views of these philosophers that arose as rejections of the Aristotelian philosophy of the Scholastic tradition.  Particular attention will be given to the relation between philosophy and the scientific revolution as well as to philosophical theories of our knowledge of the external world, the relation between mind and body, the existence and attributes of God, and the nature of physical matter, causation, space and time.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe goal of the course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to historical and contemporary debates about the issues of freedom and responsibility.  We will look at the following questions (among others):  What is freedom of will?  What is it to be a free agent, or to have freedom of thought?  What kind of freedom do we require to be morally responsible for what we do?  Are freedom and responsibility possible if what we do is ultimately governed by deterministic laws?  Can moral agency be realized in the natural world?Readings will be drawn from both historical and contemporary sources.  Prerequisite: at least eight units in philosophy.Texts:G.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHumans, and possibly certain other creatures, are conscious. Life would have no personal meaning, it wouldn’t matter one bit (to each of us individually, at any rate), if it were not for consciousness. But what is consciousness? Does possession of consciousness require possession of a non-physical soul or does mind = brain in which case it will eventually be explained by neuroscience? Did some deity endow us with consciousness or is consciousness just one quirky outcome of the blind force of evolution by natural selection? Does my possession of a mind equip me with a free will that allows for personal responsibility, as well as blame and praise, for my actions? If my mind is just my brain then in what sense, am I free – the brain after all is just a 3 lb. piece of tissue and biology is thought to be governed by natural laws. Indeed, some have suggested that the idea of free will is an illusion. The course will introduce students to the main problems in the philosophy of mind: the nature of consciousness, the mind-body relation, free-will vs. determinism, the nature of personal identity. Nothing less that the meaning of life and the nature of morality rest on our understanding of our minds. No prior background in philosophy is required. Students interested in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, medicine, religion, and law will find much to interest them. Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to moral and political philosophy.  We will
consider a range of ethical issues regarding individual conduct as well as
social arrangements, policies, and practices.  We will begin by
considering whether there are objective ethical truths, examining several
arguments for the view that ethics is not objective as well as responses
to those arguments.  Next we will consider what, if anything, well-off
individuals are obligated to do to aid the very poor.  We will then
examine the ethics of meat consumption, abortion, and euthanasia.  Next we
will look at two influential views of distributive justice, and consider
whether equality is a moral ideal that we should endorse and seek to
achieve.  We will then examine the ethics of affirmative action, and the
issues of free speech, tolerance, and multiculturalism.  We will conclude
by considering some ethical issues regarding war and terrorism.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to philosophy
 by doing philosophy of mind. We will begin by taking up the
 traditional question: What kind of thing is the mind? In connection
 with this question, we will engage with philosophers who think of the
 contents of the mind, things such as ideas, perceptions, beliefs,
 dreams, and imaginings, as something like pictures. We will focus on
 dreams in particular. From there, we will move on to an enormous
 question in the philosophy of mind which brings together a number of
 fascinating issues: Are human beings free? And if so, to what extent
 are they free and in what areas of our mental life does our freedom
 lie? In connection with this question, we will look at some writings
 in psychoanalysis and spend some time thinking about one particularly
 important domain of our freedom, namely: love. Throughout the course,
 we will learn how to read, think, speak, and write critically and with
 great precision and rigor.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will read major works of literature with a philosophical eye.  In particular, we will examine how works drawn from the Ancient, Medieval, and Modern periods offer different viewpoints on issues including (but not limited to!) the following: humankind’s place in the world, the form of ‘the good life’, freedom and responsibility, the status and content of morality, the value of different social relationships…and the nature of the divine and how it relates to all of the foregoing.  The texts for the course are Homer’s The Odyssey, Dante’s The Inferno, and Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov.  It should be noted that there will be quite a lot of reading for this course – usually 50-70 pages a night, with no real breaks.  There will be several in-class writing assignments designed, in part, to reward those who keep up with the reading schedule. Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat is it for an argument to be deductively valid? Intuitively, what’s
required is that the conclusion “follow from” the premises, or that the
truth of the premises “guarantee” the truth of the conclusion.  In this
course we will look at how to make this intuitive notion of validity
formally precise.  To this end, we will learn how to represent the
logical form of English arguments in increasingly more fine-grained
ways, and how to use semantic and syntactic methods to demonstrate the
validity of arguments given such formal representations.  Upon
completing the course, students can expect to be familiar with the basic
concepts of symbolic logic and to be in a better position to formulate
and evaluate arguments in natural languages like English.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will survey some of the main metaphysical and epistemological positions of five important early modern philosophers:  Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant.  We will be concerned with their views regarding the structure of reality (the existence of God; the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body; the nature of bodies; causation) and with how we relate to the world around us (perception; the possibility of knowledge about the external world; induction).  We will consider these views in light of the scientific developments of the 17th and 18th centuries, as reactions to Aristotelian doctrine, and in their own right.  Previously taught:

Are you allowed to buy yourself an iPod when you could use the money to save people from starving?  Should you buy a hybrid, rather than an SUV, when your individual choice is just “a drop in the bucket” and won’t really affect global warming?  Is there any difference between terrorism and “collateral damage”?  May we kill enemy soldiers or even civilians to protect ourselves?  Is abortion wrong?  Is it wrong to kill yourself to spare yourself a future of pain and debilitation?  Is it wrong for a doctor to help you to do this?  What is the point of punishing criminals?  Is there any point in it?  What do we owe to future generations?  Is it wrong to bring children into this world?These questions can be difficult for many different reasons.  Self-interest, prejudice, and fear can cloud our judgment.  Religious authorities that we accept on faith, such as the Bible, can give unclear or conflicting directions.  Finally, it can be hard to be sure of relevant facts: for example, whether the justice system applies the death penalty consistently, or whether burning fossil fuels leads to climate change.This course, however, is about another set of difficulties, which persist when we set aside our personal feelings, we see how far we can get without relying on faith, and we assume that we know the relevant facts.  We may not be able to decide, by our own reflection and reasoning, which answers are correct, and even when we are sure that certain answers are correct, we may not be able to justify them.  Our ethical ideas may seem not up to the task.  Our aim in this course is to come to terms with these difficulties and to see to what extent they can be overcome.Previously taught:

classical China, including Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism.
Although the course is meant primarily as a survey of the most important
Chinese thinkers, a prominent theme will be their views on moral cultivation

Its aim is to draw together Berkeley faculty and graduate students studying the “moral emotions” – pride, shame, guilt, and anger – as well as related concepts and motivations, such as attributions of responsibility, altruism, self-interest, virtue, and character.  These concepts and emotions lie not only at the heart of moral and political philosophy, but also psychology, education, sociology, and economics.  Our seminar will pursue these subjects by looking at the intersection of research within these different disciplines, with each session introduced by one or more of the faculty conveners.  Graduate student participants will share responsibility for presenting some material, and will be expected to collaborate across disciplinary lines for their seminar projects.  We also expect campus and off-campus visitors to contribute to the meetings and possible special sessions.The seminar will meet in the Geballe Room of the Townsend Center on Wednesdays, 4-6pm. Graduate students from any university department are invited to apply, but space is limited, and admission will require the approval of the instructors.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will compare and contrast the Greek, Medieval, and Modern worlds as expressed in their greatest literature. We will follow in detail how in the West polytheism gradually became more and more monolithic until everything was understood in relation to a single God, and then how this synthesis fell apart and left our culture with a choice between nihilism or a return to polytheism.  The goal of the course is both to illustrate how to read difficult texts and to provide an understanding of the cultural paradigms that have formed and focused our shared beliefs and practices.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaBy any (reasonable) account, human beings have more knowledge today than ever before due to the progress of science, but there is still philosophical disagreement about what knowledge is, how we should respond to radical skepticism, and how much science itself can tell us about knowledge. In this problem-oriented course we will study contemporary classics of epistemology on the topics of tracking, closure, relevant alternatives, reliabilism, internalism, externalism, and contextualism, among others. We will take epistemology to be responsible for understanding scientific cases of knowledge, and also consider the implications for epistemology of results in experimental psychology suggesting human beings’ lack of awareness of their true reasons for belief.Previously taught:

After introducing the basic concepts of game theory, the first part of the course will be devoted to problems of cooperation and convention: how people manage to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit, e.g. drive on the same side of the road, carry out a project together, or use language. The next section will explore non-cooperative games, such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma; the possible application of these games to moral problems; and the need for and execution of a social contract. Finally, we turn to problems dealing with groups, such as the problem of collective action, and some issues in group decision making.Previously taught:

It will focus on the conception of happiness as the good life, the distinction of character virtues and intellectual virtues as the basis of his phi-losophy of action.  It will also elucidate the Aristotelian explanation for the phenomenon of akrasia, his conception and evaluation of pleasure, and take up the controversy whether Aristotle’s explanation of the philosophical life as the supreme good is consistent with his basic principles of the good life.  The discussion will focus mainly on the text but also take note of crucial discussions in the secondary literature.

The rest of the seminar will focus mostly on the New Essays on Human Understanding, a work in which Leibniz presents his philosophical views on the philosophy of mind, epistemology, and metaphysics, in a detailed response to Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding. We will be especially interested in Leibniz’s views about knowledge and representation, and in the significance, for the development of Kant’s thought, of Leibniz’s complex and interconnected views about apperception, perception, concepts, thought, reflection, memory, and innate ideas.Required Texts:

We will conduct three case studies, each on a different fragment of language: (1) the language of spatio-temporal position and orientation; (2) the language of probability; and (3) the language of evaluation (probably, aesthetic evaluation). We will use these fragments as windows into some basic issues in the philosophy of language, among them: the role of charity and of eligibility in interpretation, the scope and limits of truth-conditional semantics, the import of the demand that a theory of meaning be compositional, and the epistemological role of intuition in linguistics. We will be especially interested in developing a view about how semantic inquiry and metaphysical inquiry are related. 
Our case studies will drive us into areas well outside of the usual terrain of the philosophy of language, and the readings will be correspondingly diverse. During our first case study, we will look at aspects of the metaphysics of space and time, and at work on the perception of orientation; during the second, we will look into the metaphysics of probability, and get into issues about the semantics and logic of conditionals; and during the third, several reading will come from meta-ethics and aesthetics. Some people we may read: Chomsky, Egan, Field, Fillmore, Fodor, Gibbard, Gillies, Harman, Hume (on taste), Kant (on gloves), Kolodny, Kripke, Lee, Lewis, MacFarlane, Rothschild, Schroeder, Searle, Skow, Stalnaker, and Yalcin.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe main purpose of this course is to answer the question, “How does language relate to the world?” In order to do this we will have to explore a lot of related questions, such as those concerning the nature of truth, reference, meaning, speech acts, metaphors, fiction, and pictures. We will also try to develop a general theoretical account of how human linguistic behavior is related to the rest of human behavior and to human mental states.There are two parts to the course. In the first part, I will explain how I think language ought to be studied philosophically. The philosophy of language is a branch of the philosophy of mind. In the second part of the course, I will teach mainstream philosophy of language, and attempt both to explain and criticize it.Previously taught:

While examining the ways these problems arise and the answers that Plato gives to them in this influential text, we will be asking ourselves whether these are answers we could endorse.
The issues that we will examine will include:
What does being a just or good person involve? Why do we want to be good or just?
How should our social institutions be structured in order to promote a just state? What should education be like, and what is it for? Is it ever permissible for the government to lie to the people? Is censorship ever justified? What role should women have in society? In order to understand Plato’s answers to these questions, we will delve into his moral psychology (the nature of the soul, of virtue, of moral beliefs, and the relation between reason and emotion) as well as the metaphysical and epistemological aspects of Plato’s Theory of Forms.Prerequisite: At least 8 units of philosophy or the instructor’s consent.Set translation:“Republic”, translated by Grube, revised by Reeve (Hackett).Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicates the intuitive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’) and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’). In addition, we will also develop techniques for showing when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus. Textbook: J. Barwise, J.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn introduction to the history of modern philosophy through the problems and ideas of some of the most important philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  The course will focus on close reading and discussion of some of the major works of René Descartes, John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant.  Two lecture-discussion meetings and one discussion-section with a Graduate Student Instructor each week.  Several short papers during the semester and a final examination.  Written work will be assessed on the basis of its clarity, accuracy, and level of understanding of the philosophical issues in question.  Problems to be investigated, as they appear in the work of the different philosophers, include: What do we perceive, and how does it enable us to think and know things about the world?  What can we know of our own existence and nature?  How is the mind related to the body?  Do objects in the world really have colors, tastes, and smells, or do we only think so because of their effects on us?  Can we know that at least in general the world really is the way we believe it to be?  Can we have reason to believe things about what we have not so far experienced?  What is the difference between two things’ being connected as cause and effect and a mere coincidence, and how can we tell which is which?  Must we think some things are causally connected with others in order to think about an independent world at all?  Can we know some such things by thought alone, without dependence on sense-perception?  If so, what things, and how?  Is there a distinctive way in which philosophy asks and answers questions like these?  Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA course to encourage in philosophy majors the practice and development of the skills of reading and writing in philosophy. Readings will be drawn from recent essays on a variety of subjects in different areas of philosophy. These will be discussed in one two-hour classroom meeting each week. Students will be expected to read and discuss the essays in class and to write clearly and accurately about them and about the questions they raise. Each student will meet individually each week with a graduate student instructor for close assessment and discussion of the student’s writing with special attention to how it could be improved.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will explore topics in the philosophy of art. What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century).Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.This course is an upper division philosophy course. it is intended for students with some background in philosophy.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will examine some of the basic concepts of politics and specifically the concept of the political. This concern is motivated by the thought that our traditional understanding of politics (going ultimately back to Plato and Aristotle) has come or is coming apart. In the middle section of the course attention will be focused on the work of Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, and Michel Foucault and their attempts to re-conceptualize the field of politics. The final third of the course will consider how questions concerning technology, terrorism, globalization, and the environment affect the way we need to think about politics.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe single most important question in philosophy, and in intellectual life generally, at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action?
Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers?
How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments?
This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California“Philosophical logic” includes both (a) the philosophical investigation of the fundamental concepts of logic and (b) the deployment of logical methods in the service of philosophical ends. We’ll tackle five interconnecting topics in philosophical logic:Quantifiers:  You may think you learned everything there is to
 know about quantifiers in Philosophy 12A. But in fact, there are
 quite a few quantificational idioms that we can’t understand in
 terms of the quantification theory you learned. We’ll look at the
 logic of identity, numerical quantifiers, generalized quantifiers,
 definite descriptions, substitutional quantifiers, and plural
 quantifiers.Modal logic: In addition to talking about what is the case, we
 talk about what might have been the case and what could not have
 been otherwise. Modal logic gives us tools to analyze reasoning
 involving these notions. We’ll get a basic grasp on some of the
 fundamentals of propositional modal logic, and then delve into
 some hairy conceptual problems surrounding quantified modal
 logic, explored by Quine, Kripke, and others. We’ll also look at
 the famous “slingshot argument,” which was used by Quine and
 Davidson to reject modal logic and correspondence theories of
 truth. At this point our work on definite descriptions will come
 in handy!Logical consequence: If you ask what logic is about, a
 reasonable (though not completely satisfactory) answer is that
 it’s the study of what follows from what, that is, of logical
 consequence. But how should we think of this relation? We’ll start
 by looking at Tarski’s account of logical consequence, which has
 become the orthodox account. On this account, logical consequence
 is a matter of truth preservation: P follows from Q if there is
 no model on which P is true and Q false. We’ll talk about how this
 account relates to the older idea that P follows from Q if it is
 impossible for P to be true and Q false. Then we’ll consider
 some alternatives. One alternative is to define consequence in
 terms of proof. We’ll look at a version of this idea by Dag
 Prawitz, which yields a nonclassical logic called “intuitionistic
 logic.” We’ll then look at the suggestion that relevance in
 addition to truth preservation is required for logical
 consequence. We’ll see how one might develop a nonclassical
 “relevance logic,” and we’ll consider some technical and
 philosophical issues that speak for and against a requirement of
 relevance. Finally, we’ll consider how, exactly, logic relates to
 reasoning.Conditionals: In Philosophy 12A you were taught to translate
 English conditionals using the “material conditional,” a
 truth-functional connective. This leads to some odd results: for
 example, “If I am currently on Mars, then I am a hippopotamus”
 comes out true (since the antecedent is false). We’ll start by
 considering some attempts to defend the material-conditional
 analysis of indicative conditionals in English. Then we’ll
 consider some alternatives, inculding Edgington’s view that
 indicative conditionals have no truth-conditions, Stalnaker’s
 elegant modal account, and the view that indicative conditionals
 should be understood as conditional assertions. Finally, we’ll
 look at McGee’s “counterexample to modus ponens,” and consider
 whether this sacrosanct inference rule is actually invalid!Vagueness: Finally we’ll turn to the “sorites paradox,” or
 paradox of the heap, which argues: five thousand grains of sand
 make a heap; taking one grain away from a heap still leaves you
 with a heap; so…one grain of sand makes a heap. Philosophical
 logicians have suggested that it is a mistake to use classical
 logic and semantics in analyzing this argument, and they have
 proposed a number of alternatives. We’ll consider three of them:
 (a) a three-valued logic, (b) a continuum-valued (or fuzzy) logic,
 and © a supervaluational approach that preserves classical logic
 (mostly) but not classical semantics. If there’s time, we’ll also
 look at a short argument by Gareth Evans that purports to show
 that vagueness must be a semantic phenomenon: that is, that there
 is no vagueness “in the world.”Requirements will include both papers and problem sets.Prerequisites: Philosophy 12A or equivalent, and at least one other course in philosophy. The course covers some technical material, but knowledge of logic beyond 12A will not be assumed.Books: Course Reader.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe normative reasons at the center of moral life have distinctive features that encourage us to think of them as sources of practical necessity. In this seminar we will look at three different ideas that contribute to this sense of the special rational force of moral considerations: inescapability (the idea that morality provides reasons to all agents, without regard to their special preferences and tastes and interests); deontic structure (the sense that moral considerations enter the deliberative field, as it were, in the guise of requirements); and importance (the idea that moral reasons are significant enough to prevail against the kinds of personal consideration with which they might come into conflict). Readings will be drawn from the contemporary literature on morality, normativity, and practical reason, including some work in progress by the instructor.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will mainly focus on Plato’s metaphysics and epistemology to elucidate what is meant by ‘Platonism’.  It therefore tries to reconstruct the development of the theory of Forms from its first traces in some of Plato’s early dialogues to its application in his middle years and possible revisions in his late work.  This reconstruction will at the same time require a discussion of the development in Plato’s theory of knowledge and of the methods he uses in connection with his different treatment of the Forms.  The focus will be on the central passages for this topic in Plato’s Euthyphro, Meno, Phaedo, Republic, Symposium, Phaedrus, Parmenides, Sophist, and the Philebus.
The discussion will focus largely on Plato’s texts but important secondary literature will be included and made available on bspace.  Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA course of close reading and detailed discussion of central parts of Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations.  The aim is to understand Wittgenstein’s later work and its philosophical significance by responding as directly and as sympathetically as possible to the problems and lines of thought as they are presented in that book.  Some other works of Wittgenstein and some interpretative commentary will be consulted occasionally, but the emphasis throughout will be on that book alone.  Because the book embodies a conception of philosophy as a certain kind of activity, the course will be of greatest interest and value to those willing to engage in philosophical reflection of their own in response to Wittgenstein’s thinking.  That requires careful attention to the text, active participation in classroom discussion in response to others’ contributions, and an effort to keep sharpening one’s own understanding of the issues in question.  The course is meant to be as much as possible a course in doing philosophy, not just a commentary on somebody’s philosophy.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will explore the questions about the relationship between
science and religion.  If we take current science seriously, what room, if
any, is left for religion?  We will look at the assumptions behind doing
science and the assumptions behind practicing religion, and examine
whether these conflict.  We will also examine whether evolutionary theory
leaves room for the existence of a God who intervenes; whether the
“fine-tuning” of the physical constants is evidence for God’s existence
and whether the Anthropic Principle constitutes a good reply to the
fine-tuning argument; and whether one can survive one’s own death. 
Finally, we will examine what faith is and the relationship between faith,
religious belief, and evidence.This course is intended for graduate students in philosophy, but advanced
undergraduates may enroll with permission.  No background in philosophy of
religion or philosophy of science is required.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIt is often thought that the fact that a collective policy has been democratically selected is a reason, of a moral character, in favor of complying, or not interfering, with it.  Either the fact that a policy was democratically selected /strengthens /the objection that others have to one’s refusing to comply with it (or to one’s interfering with it), thereby adding to the case for one’s being morally /required /to comply (or to refrain from interfering) with it.  Or it /weakens /the objection that one has to their doing otherwise objectionable things in pursuit of that policy (such as threatening coercive force), thereby adding to the case for their being morally /permitted /to do those things.  Why?  No doubt, the fact that a collective policy is /substantively good/—good in ways that do not depend on what individuals have decided, or think, about it—is a reason, often of a broadly moral character, to comply with it.  But why should the fact that people /think /that the policy is good, or /choose /it, be a reason to comply with it?  We will read work on these questions by Charles Beitz, Joshua Cohen, Thomas Christiano, and David Estlund.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis class will survey some recent literature in

between Properties and Particulars, Supervenience and Constitution,
Fundamentality, Intrinsicness, External vs Internal Relations,
Quantities and Measurement, The Causal Theory of Properties, Humean

Yet they seem to be more than mere reports of my own tastes and information; for example, they can serve as loci of interpersonal disagreements. So how should we understand them? Both expressivism and relativism advertise themselves as ways of steering between the Scylla of excessive subjectivism and the Charybdis of excessive objectivism. In this seminar we will look at both approaches, with a focus on expressivism. We will be particularly concerned with understanding just how the two approaches differ, when both are fully developed, and how each differs from the subjectivist and objectivist views they are seeking to avoid. For concreteness and to ease comparison, we will focus on claims of taste and likelihood, even though much of the discussion concerns normative judgment. Readings will be drawn from A. J. Ayer, C. L. Stevenson, Peter Geach, Simon Blackburn, Allan Gibbard, Huw Price, Mark Schroeder, Frank Jackson, Jamie Dreier, Gideon Rosen, and others (including some unpublished work of my own).Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is a course about the use of probability in epistemology. Probability imports assumptions about and imposes constraints on any subject matter you use it to describe. Some of these constraints are well-known, but their implications are not always known or observed. In others it is an open question how much leeway probability allows. We discuss the fate of holism, foundationalism, introspective access, self-knowledge, and objects of belief under a probabilistic description. We consider the consequences of the globality of the P function and of extreme probabilities. Cases that are illuminating include the preface “paradox,” evidential support, re-calibration, justified belief, and the epistemology of logic. We discuss artifacts of representation and how to think about idealization in philosophy.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe foundational program known as “predicativity” took its start from the debate between Poincaré and Russell on the nature of logic and received already in 1918 an impressive formulation and systematization in Weyl’s The Continuum. By the 1950s the logical tools required for a logical analysis of the notion had been developed. In the last two decades reflection on predicativity has prospered not only from the foundational point of view but also from the philosophical point of view. Recent work by, among others, Parsons, Burgess, Wright, Dummett, Feferman, and Hellman has revived the discussion on predicativity and its connections to issues such as neologicism, indispensability arguments etc. In the seminar we will begin by looking at the classical positions by Poincaré and Weyl and after a brief interlude on the logical characterization of predicativity given by Feferman and Schütte in the sixties we will focus on some of the most recent philosophical discussions mentioned above.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

In the first two books of the Physics, his introductory work on natural science, Aristotle articulates and argues for some of his most well known philosophical doctrines. They serve as an excellent introduction to central issues in Aristotle’s philosophy. In these short two books he addresses such issues as:What is required in order to explain changes?What makes it the case that something is natural? What is a cause?Do some things occur by chance?Are natural phenomena, such as the growth of a tree, solely due to properties of its material constituents? Or are there additional causal factors?In this course, we will use Physics I and II as a guide, drawing on works from throughout the Aristotelian corpus. In addition to understanding what Aristotle’s positions are, we will also ask ourselves whether, and to what extent, the concepts and distinctions that Aristotle employs are still tenable. If they are, in what sorts of contexts can they be applied? If not, what does this tell us about our own philosophical outlook and presuppositions? The format of this course will be a seminar, and enrollment is limited to 20 participants(For this semester, this course may satisfy the 160-178 requirement for the major.)Previously taught:

One of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century, Being and Time is both a systematization of the existential insights of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and a radicalization of Husserl’s phenomenological account of intentionality.  What results is an original interpretation of the human condition and an account of the nature and limitations of philosophical and scientific theory.  This account has important implications for all those disciplines that study human beings. Prerequisites:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaNOTE: For the Spring 2011 semester, this Religious Studies course may be used as an upper-division Philosophy elective towards the Major.The course focuses on major founding insights, principles and practical explication of the ethics of rights and ideas on justice, both in Western and Eastern traditions and in- between (Hellenistic, Indian, Chinese, Postcolonial). The course examines the foundational basis in morality for cultural values, religious beliefs and practices, law, justice and human rights, and ecological attitudes, as these have developed from classical to contemporary times, in religions and secular idelogies. Following a survey of key Western moral systems, beginning with their religious roots, including ideas of justice and liberalism, and their critiques (Plato, Socrates, Augustine, Grotius, Kant, Hegel, Mills, MacIntyre, Williams, Rawls, Nozick, Cavell, Sen, Nussbaum), the course critically engages Hindu, Buddhist-Jaina (Dharma) ethics, and their responses to the Asia’s moral, social and legal challenges. Similar issues are examined in the context of the dynastic and Confucian vs Daoist debates in Chinese texts. In terms of structure, the theoretical part of the course will map the formative impact of competing ethical theories that have determined the culture, or have in turn been criticized and transformed in their respective intellectual histories. The latter part will center on practical moral issues, particularly the dialectics of caste/class hierarchy versus autonomy of the individual, despotic governance vs democratic/liberal processes, rights trumping rites (duties), patriarchy vs gender justice, virtues vs instrumentalism, normativity vs intuition, as well as bioethical, animal and environmental issues. How the cultures of East & West, comparatively, have meet these challenges amidst diversity and plurality of communities, moral ideals, legal systems and practices is a question that will also inform the inquiry.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to moral and political philosophy. We will
consider a range of ethical issues regarding individual conduct as well as
social arrangements, policies, and practices. We will begin by considering
whether there are objective ethical truths, examining several arguments
for the view that ethics is not objective as well as responses to those
arguments. Next we will consider what, if anything, well-off individuals
are obligated to do to aid the very poor. We will then examine the ethics
of meat consumption, abortion, and euthanasia. Next we will look at two
influential views of distributive justice, and consider whether equality
is a moral ideal that we should endorse and seek to achieve. We will then
examine the ethics of affirmative action, and the issues of free speech,
tolerance, and multiculturalism. We will conclude by considering some
ethical issues regarding war and terrorism.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat is it for an argument to be deductively valid? Intuitively,
what’s required is that the conclusion “follow from” the premises, or
that the truth of the premises “guarantee” the truth of the
conclusion.  In this course we will look at how this notion is made
formally precise in three systems of logic: sentential logic, monadic
predicate logic, and full first order logic.  We will learn how to
represent the logical forms of English arguments in each of these
systems, and then develop a semantics as well as a system of natural
deduction in each system to assess the validity of arguments given
such formal representations.  Upon completing the course, students can
expect to be familiar with the basic concepts of symbolic logic, and
to be in a better position to formulate and evaluate arguments in
natural languages like English.Previously taught:

generally, and ancient philosophy in particular.  Those new to
philosophy will learn the landscape by reading and writing about
knowledge, the nature of reality, psychology, and ethics as the Greeks
saw it.  Those with experience in philosophy will see that the ancient
perspective is an excellent starting point not just for its historical
role in philosophy, but also for its contrast to many of our modern
instincts and at the same time for its relevance to ongoing
philosophical debates.  We will get acquainted with the striking
differences between ancient and modern thinkers, and with the very
elements for which Socrates, Plato and Aristotle are considered the
founders of Western philosophy.Previously taught:

epistemological positions of five important early modern
philosophers:  Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant.  We will
be concerned with their views regarding the structure of reality (the
existence of God; the nature of the human mind and its relation to the
body; the nature of bodies; causation) and with how we relate to the
world around us (perception; the possibility of knowledge about the
external world; induction).  We will consider these views in light of
the scientific developments of the 17th and 18th centuries, as
reactions to Aristotelian doctrine, and in their own right.Previously taught:

Life would have no personal meaning, it wouldn’t matter one bit (to each of us individually, at any rate), if it were not for consciousness. But what is consciousness? Does possession of consciousness require possession of a non-physical soul or does mind = brain in which case it will eventually be explained by neuroscience? Did some deity endow us with consciousness or is consciousness just one quirky outcome of the blind force of evolution by natural selection? Does my possession of a mind equip me with a free will that allows for personal responsibility, as well as blame and praise, for my actions? If my mind is just my brain then in what sense, am I free — the brain after all is just a 3 lb. piece of tissue and biology is thought to be governed by natural laws. Indeed, some have suggested that the idea of free will is an illusion.The course will introduce students to the main problems in the philosophy of mind: the nature of consciousness, the mind-body relation, free-will vs. determinism, the nature of personal identity. Nothing less that the meaning of life and the nature of morality rest on our understanding of our minds. No prior background in philosophy is required. Students interested in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, medicine, religion, and law will find much to interest them.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will provide an examination of Kant’s critical philosophy. The first part will be devoted to the peculiarity of Kant’s Copernican Revolution, understanding transcendental idealism to be a necessary condition for empirical realism. In this part we will be primarily concerned with Kant’s his relationship to Leibniz and Wolff, his view of philosophy’s proper ‘method’, and the proof structure of the ‘transcendental deduction”. The readings will include in addition to sections from the Critique of Pure Reason and the Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics extracts from his dissertation. The second part of the course will deal with what is for Kant a condition for a subject to exhibit one’s freedom, i.e. his understanding of autonomy and its development from the lecture notes on moral philosophy by Kaehler via the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals to the Critique of Practical Reason. In the end of the course the relationship of these two critiques will be discussed and questions will be raised about the whole system that is supposed to be the outcome of the combination of Kant’s three critiques.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis class is an introduction to moral and political philosophy that 
will cover three general areas. First, we will examine Utilitarianism, a 
divisive theory of normative ethics that will provide us the opportunity 
to learn and practice techniques for constructing and evaluating moral 
theories. Through reading the work of proponents and detractors, we will 
investigate how to argue for or against a specific theory of what one 
ought to do, and we will briefly consider an alternative picture in the 
form of Kantianism. Second, we will turn to some questions about the 
foundations and objectivity of moral claims, what is usually called 
“meta-ethics.” Can moral claims be true? Are any moral claims true? True 
for whom? You, our country, everyone? What could make them true? In this 
part of the course, we will structure our investigation around a single 
sustained piece of philosophical writing that explores these very 
questions. Finally, we will attempt to apply what we have learned about 
foundations and theories in moral philosophy to a few specific issues 
that will move our discussion into the domain of the political. These 
issues will include the moral status of non-human animals, the 
permissibility of abortion, freedom of speech and expression, and 
justifications of partiality and nationalism.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to the philosophical study of the mind.
We will start off by investigating the Mind-Body problem: that is, how
exactly are the mind and body related to one another? Are they two
wholly separate things? Or is the mind just identical to the brain?
Alternatively, the mind might just be a computer program, with the
implication that machines could be capable of thought and other mental
states. We will study the strong and weak points of all of these
theories: Dualism, Identity Theory, Behaviorism and Functionalism.
  We will go on to look at the phenomenon of consciousness. We will ask:
what is consciousness? Can we describe it scientifically? What is
special about the conscious states that we refer to as “emotions”? We
will end the course by studying how we should regard the content of our
mental states. In essence, we will try to see if content is internally
or externally determined. How much does the environment in which we are
placed get into our heads? Again, the overarching theme and goal of
this question, as well as all the others, will be a deeper
understanding of how our minds and the physical world around us are
related.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat is justice?  Where do the mandates of justice come from and why do they have authority over us?  How do we know what is just?  When and how should wrongdoers be punished?  Is it better to be just than unjust?  A long line of philosophers have asked these questions.  Though they often disagree wildly, their exploration of the questions tends to take a similar form.  An author articulates a view, presents objections to that view, then defends the view.  Fiction, poetry, autobiography work differently.  In this course, we will consider classic works of Western literature, both fiction and non-fiction.  We will consider how these texts explore questions about justice, the answers that they offer us (if any), and how all of this relates to philosophical debates about justice.  As we go along, we will contrast texts from Ancient Greece, early and medieval Christianity, the Enlightenment, and more contemporary times.Previously taught:

working knowledge of Propositional and Predicate Logic. Students will
learn how to translate natural language expressions into formal language,
and then explore important semantic notions like logical consequence,
consistency and tautology. Students will also learn natural deduction
proof systems for both logics, and if time permits, some metatheoretical
issues will be covered, such as the soundness and completeness of the
propositional calculus.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course provides a survey of some of the works of
six major figures central to the development of philosophical thought in
the early modern period: Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and
Kant. We
will focus on these figures’ work in the areas of metaphysics and
epistemology and trace the development of particular philosophical
problems and ideas through each figure. Questions we will be examining
include: What is the mind, and what is its relation to the body? What is
God? What does perception reveal, and what are its limits? What can we
know through the faculty of reason alone? We will consider these and other
questions, and how they were approached, both within their historical
contexts and as they stand on their own.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis introductory course will examine the works of four classical protagonists of Western political thought, Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, and John Rawls. It is meant to provide students with a basic understanding of paradigmatic ancient, modern, and contemporary political theories: An understanding of the respective metaphysical and ontological, rationalist and contractarian approaches that essentially inform these theories; of the underlying anthropological assumptions; of the relevance and specific meaning of concepts such as justice, freedom, security, and power; and, most importantly, of differing strategies of justifying the existence of the state philosophically. Thus, based on a careful reading of their politico-philosophical writings, it is to be considered how Plato and Aristotle, Hobbes and Rawls aim at finding a balance that resolves the tension that inescapably exists between (stately) authority and (individual) autonomy. Additionally, the course aims at identifying the concepts of the political that implicitly or explicitly organize the political theories discussed.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe subject of the seminar will be Language and Consciousness.  I want to approach a series of traditional problems in the Philosophy of Language from a new angle.  I want to adopt a more “naturalistic” approach than I have done in my published work or than is common in the tradition of the Philosophy of Language.  I want to develop the idea that we can explain a lot of features of language by developing the idea that language evolves as an extension of more biologically primitive forms of intentionality in perception, action and consciousness generally.  The structure of the proposition, and particularly the unity of the proposition as well as the use of language to create a social and institutional reality have, I believe, profound biological bases.I want to begin the seminar with these issues and then branch out further into questions about consciousness generally and other problems in the philosophy of language.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will give an overview of Hegel’s philosophy in order to make students familiar with the significance of ‘absolute idealism’ in the philosophy of the 18th and 19th century. The major themes that will be discussed are: Hegel’s criticism of Empiricism as presented in the Phenomenology of Sprit, his account of experience in the Phenomenology of Sprit and the Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences, Hegel’s criticism of Kant and his pursuing the aim to show skepticism to be ultimately unintelligible; as it is argued for in the Logic of Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences and by the idea of a unity of the three volumes of the Encyclopedia. 
We shall be interested in reading closely the section on consciousness in the Phenomenology of Sprit, the ‘three attitudes of thought to objectivity’ in the Encyclopedia I and the section ‘subjective logic’ in the same work. This course will also cover essential ideas in Hegel’s thoughts about mind, nature and history in order to make understandable the relationship envisages of a philosophy of mind, logic and nature.     The course will presuppose no prior knowledge of Hegel. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will introduce students to the major schools of philosophy in classical China, including Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism. Although the course is meant primarily as a survey of the most important Chinese thinkers, a prominent theme will be their views on moral cultivation and moral agency. Philosophers of this era were greatly interested in the development of good character and the key features of proper moral knowledge and motivation.

We will examine several movements in recent philosophy of science ranging from logical positivism to realism and anti-realism about scientific theories and entities. We will also examine philosophical problems in specific sciences, including, for example, physics.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.Previously taught:

provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek 
philosophical thinking from the pre-Socratic beginnings to the 
hellenistic period. The bulk of the course will be spent on the analysis 
of the philosophical motives, methods and views of Socrates (469 - 399 
BC), Plato (427-347 BC), and Aristotle (384-322 BC). Since the ancient 
Greeks identified many of the philosophical problems (and  models for 
their resolution) we are still concerned with today, the course may also 
serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally.Previously taught:

It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy.  Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills.  This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the problem of personal identity.  There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading.  In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper.Text: Personal Identity, edited by John Perry, University of California PressPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy.  We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as influential work by important contemporary philosophers (including Korsgaard, Nagel, Scanlon, and Williams).  Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)?  Why should we care about complying with moral demands?  What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)?  Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn upper-division course on the philosophical theory of knowledge.  Not a general survey of the field, but an examination and discussion of the nature and source of three fundamental epistemological problems.How does what we perceive by the senses on a particular 
occasion give us knowledge of what is so in our immediate
environment at that time?How does what we perceive or have perceived in the past give
us reason to believe something about what we have not yet 
perceived?How does what one person perceives to be true of another person 
give the perceiver reason to believe something about what the other
person thinks or feels?It has proved difficult to find philosophically satisfying explanations of knowledge or reasonable beliefs of these kinds.  This course will concentrate on the distinctive philosophical character of the problems, on the conceptions of human perception, thought, belief, and knowledge that appear to be responsible for the ‘sceptical’ outcome in each case, and on how, if at all, these obstacles are to be overcome.Two lecture-discussion classes and one mandatory discussion section each week.  Lectures and discussions will presuppose close reading of material available in a Philosophy 122 Reader.  Barry Stroud’s The Significance of Philosophical Scepticism would be useful as background.In addition to whatever writing is assigned in connection with discussion sections, students will be expected to write three five-page papers during the semester, one on each of the three philosophical questions.  Possible paper topics will be suggested in each case.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe main purpose of this course is to answer the question, “How does language relate to the world?” In order to do this we will have to explore a lot of related questions, such as those concerning the nature of truth, reference, meaning, speech acts, metaphors, fiction, and pictures. We will also try to develop a general theoretical account of how human linguistic behavior is related to the rest of human behavior and to human mental states.There are two parts to the course. In the first part, I will explain how I think language ought to be studied philosophically. The philosophy of language is a branch of the philosophy of mind. In the second part of the course, I will teach mainstream philosophy of language, and attempt both to explain and criticize it.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHow does human society differ from that of other social animals? How is it possible that there can be an objective reality of such things as money, property, government, marriage, and universities, even though such things exist only because we believe they exist? What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail?

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will provide an intensive introduction to Descartes’s views on metaphysics, epistemology, and physics.  We will begin by examining some of Descartes’s early works on method, physics, and physiology.  We will then turn to an in-depth study of the Meditations, focusing on both Descartes’s epistemological project and his anti-scholastic metaphysics.  We will supplement our study of the Meditations with readings from the Objections and Replies, the Principles, and several important pieces of secondary literature.  Some of the issues we will discuss in this section include the method of doubt, the Cartesian circle, Descartes’s mode of presentation in the Meditations, the creation and ontological status of the eternal truths, the status of the human being, the nature of substance, and the real distinction between mind and body.  After our study of the Meditations, we will examine Descartes’s physics as presented in the Principles.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe goal of this seminar is to come to an understanding of the close connections between art, poetry and technology in Heidegger’s later philosophy. These topics will be explored through a close look at his engagement with the works of Nietzsche and Hölderlin, especially the former’s diagnosis of our nihilistic predicament (“The desert grows”) and the special status that he assigned to art. But it is not Nietzsche —according to Heidegger he ultimately failed to free himself (and us) from the fetters of metaphysics—who can point the way out of our ‘forgetfulness of being’. It is in reflective thinking, art, poetry (especially that of Hölderlin) and ‘dwelling with things’ that the ‘saving power’ is to be found.Readings will include essays and excerpts from Heidegger’s lectures on Nietzsche and Hölderlin; we will also look at such central texts as “The Origin of the Work of Art”, “The Question Concerning Technology”,  and “Building, Dwelling, Thinking”.The seminar is aimed at advanced students of philosophy, preferably with some background in the work of Heidegger and/or Nietzsche.Enrollment is limited, and by application only. Students may apply to the instructor directly (at kuk@berkeley.edu). Applications should include a brief statement outlining the applicant’s philosophical background and interest in the seminar.  All applicants will be notified via email as to the result of their application; those admitted will receive course enrollment numbers with which they can enroll in the seminar through TeleBears.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis class will address the following questions : What is it for a “stream of consciousness” to exist? What kind of structure does conscious experience have, both at a time and over time? What is it to experience time passing? Is there such a thing as “subjective time”, or “phenomenal time”, to be distinguished from the objective physical time that events occur in? What support, if any, does the experience of time provide to different views of the metaphysics of time?
We will look carefully at the notions of an “experience” and a “subject of experience”, and the idea of one experience being “unified” with another by being part of a larger experience. We will relate these ideas to certain fundamental questions about the timing and temporal structure of conscious experience (e.g. is it discrete, continuous, or something else?), including a discussion of the “unity” of experience over time. Following on from this, we’ll take a look at some different views of temporal experience, including Husserl’s “tripartite” conception. We’ll then ask whether there are aspects of temporal experience that aren’t captured by any of these views – an experience of temporal passage that isn’t an experience of temporal relations between events, or a purely subjective aspect to temporal experience, that might deserve the name “phenomenal time”. Finally, we’ll take a look at the experience of time as a source of evidence in debates about the metaphysics of time: does experience support the claim that there is an objective “moving present”, or some kind of deep asymmetry between past, present and future?
Although the focus of the class will be more philosophical than empirical, we will be taking a look at some of the empirical literature on the representation of time in the brain where it is relevant, in addition to discussing relevant philosophical literature.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaShould we recognize a private sphere of relations among individuals, sexual and intimate relations, which we consider beyond any regulation by the state? Should there be state recognition or regulation of the family, and the relations within the family? What, if anything, is wrong with prostitution? And should any such wrong be reflected in laws which govern prostitution? Should marriage have standing as a state institution? These practical questions raise a number of more general ethical concerns which will be our focus in this seminar: i.) Should some things not be for sale? ii.) In what sense, if any, is the personal political? iii.) Are there basic rights of self-ownership? iv.) Is consent the key to legitimate interaction? v.) What is involved in one person ‘objectifying’ another? vi.) Are there circumstances in which paternalism is permissible or even required?After a couple of introductory sessions in which we set up the economic, sociological and anthropological background of the main concerns of this set of issues (to the extent that there is a solid body of evidence on these matters) we will move on to consider the following topics:Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will cover some recent work on topics at the intersection of the philosophy of
language, philosophical logic, and epistemology.We will begin by considering the role of logical notions in natural language
semantics. After a review of recent work highlighting some of the nontrivial
differences between natural language and classical logic, we will ask: in what sense
does natural language have a logic? We’ll then turn to the question how the notion
of logic appropriate to natural language relates to the notion of traditional
epistemological concern. When epistemologists speak of logic as normatively
constraining belief, do they have in mind the same notion of logic? If not, how are
the notions related?In the second part of the course, we will turn to the relationship between logic and
belief, and to the related issue of how to model belief. First, what are the demands
of logic on belief? How should these demands be understood if we represent belief as
coming in degrees—that is, if we speak of credence instead? Second, what
metaphysical picture is appropriate to such a representation of belief? Is credence
in the head?In the third part of the course, we will turn to some debates about knowledge that
have been thought to depend partly on issues about natural language. The two main
questions will be these: First, how are knowledge and credence each related to
rational action? Second, is knowledge a state which is somehow relative to a
question, or to an inquiry, and if so, what is the upshot of this for questions of
traditional epistemological concern?Readings will come from Harman, Hawthorne, Stanley, Sturgeon, Rothschild, Leslie,
Christensen, Moss, and Yalcin, among others.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHow is the meaning of a whole sentence determined by the meanings of its
parts, and by its structure? This question is addressed in empirical
semantic theories for natural language. The character and content of such
theories has been a central concern both of the philosophy of language and
of recent linguistics, and it is the central focus of this course.
Students will become familiar with truth-conditional semantics for natural
language in the model-theoretic tradition stemming from the classic work
of Frege and Tarski and developed by Montague, Davidson, Lewis, and
others. We will investigate the proper treatment of predicates, modifiers,
quantifiers, modals, conditionals, names, descriptions, and attitudes
within this kind of approach to linguistic meaning. Along this the way we
will: develop a sense of what it means for a semantic theory to be
compositional; ask how debates within a compositional semantic theory

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this seminar we will take a philosophical look at some ancient questions about the meaning of life.  What is it that makes life worth living, from the agent’s point of view?  What is the relation between morality and the good life?  (Can one live well, as an individual, only if one complies with moral requirements?  Or does morality sometimes interfere with the conditions for living a meaningful life?)  Can life have meaning if there are no objective values?  What is the significance of our mortality for the question of life’s meaning?  Finally, what is the relation of philosophy itself to the meaning of life?  Is there any truth in the dictum that the unexamined life is not worth living?  Readings will be taken primarily from contemporary philosophical sources.Previously taught:

Philosophy of Mind. Is consciousness a purely physical phenomenon? Is

raft, or does our knowledge have the structure of a teepee? What are the 
requirements for knowledge? How much do we need to trust others in order 
to know? Can we trust ourselves? Can conspiracy theories ever be

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn the traditional Judeo/Christian understanding, God is the
ground of all meaning.  At the end of the Medieval World, Descartes
and Kant attempt to promote Man as an autonomous ground, taking the
traditional place of God.  The promotion of man undermines the
authority of God, but as an autonomous ground Man turns out to be
existentially insufficient.  The dual failure of God and Man as
ground, leaves us with the threat of nihilism.  The course asks:
Can we preserve the existential insight common to both traditions
that life needs some kind of ground, without finding such a ground
in a Supreme Being or in autonomous Man?The answer depends upon whether one can uncover an authority
other than us that, although not a Supreme Being, nevertheless
serves as a ground.  The course will be devoted to a series of
philosophical-religious thinkers who describe just such a
possibility.  Pascal speaks of God as essentially hidden and makes
a virtue of his hiddenness.  Kierkegaard holds that after the
God-man appears in the world we no longer have, nor do we need,
access to God the Father.  Nietzsche embraces as liberating the
sheer absence of any ground.  In opposition, Dostoyevsky attempts
to show how one can live a meaningful life that preserves the
authority of our Judeo-Christian practices without recourse to a
monotheistic metaphysics.Required Reading:   Dostoevsky, Brothers Karamazov (Dover)

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will introduce students to a variety of topics in both normative (theoretical) and applied ethics. We will focus, in particular, on the connections between the morality of individual agents and issues of social justice. At the individual level, we will consider both how one ought to live one’s life, and what kind of person one ought to be. At the social level, we will consider the nature and requirements of social justice, as well as which means society’s may be obligated or permitted to use in achieving it. Throughout the course, we will examine and reexamine the connections between the individual and social levels. To what extent, if any, do the requirements of social justice impose moral obligations on individuals? For example, if one lives in an unjust society, is one obligated to protest the injustice? What difference does it make if an individual must risk severe penalties in order to protest effectively? On the other hand, if some individuals do not behave morally, does social justice require the community to encourage or, even, enforce better behavior? It is clear that individual morality and social justice are not independent. In what ways, and to what extent, do they depend on each other? Is it possible for to live one’s life well, and to be a good moral agent, if one lives in an unjust society? To what extent must a just society depend on the morality of its individual members?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular 
the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our 
ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a 
matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we 
take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in 
the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought 
set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and 
Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the 
contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later 
Wittgenstein. We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege 
and Russell. Prerequisite: two previous courses in philosophy.Previously taught:

look at the philosophical relevance of these logical results to various 
areas of philosophy.Prerequisite: 12A (or equivalent) or permission from the instructor.Course requirements: exercise sets approximately every ten days

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will examine the main currents within Plato’s philosophy. This will include his conceptions of philosophy, the good life, the soul, causes and explanation, the hypothesis of the Forms, his account of human knowledge and some of the later developments and revisions of these conceptions. The focus will lie on Plato’s Dialogues Euthyphro, Republic, Meno, Phaedo, Symposium, Phaedrus, Parmenides, Sophist and Philebus.
The discussion will focus largely on Plato’s texts. Important secondary literature will be made available on bspace. No previous knowledge of Plato required.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSchopenhauer’s pessimism and Nietzsche’s forceful ‘affirmation of life’ seem to be worlds apart from each other.  On closer analysis though, the two philosophies are interestingly related. In addition, many of Nietzsche’s central theses can be understood properly only against the background of  Schopenhauer’s thought.The course offers a systematic comparative study of both philosophers’ interpretations of life (or existence). Particular attention will be paid to the role of art and the function of aesthetic experience in their accounts of life. Other topics to be discussed include nihilism, the nature of the will and the drives (instincts), and the relation between the rational intellect and the bodily self. Readings will include selections from Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation and central texts by Nietzsche from the different phases of his philosophy. Enrollment by instructor’s approval only. Students who would like to enroll should write a brief email to the instructor (at kuk@berkeley.edu) detailing their background in philosophy and their interest in the course. Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will discuss Kant’s aesthetic theory, focussing primarily on his
theory of the beautiful.  We will be concerned both with the theory in
its own right, and with its broader philosophical implications.
Readings will be drawn mostly from the Critique of Judgment, with some
background material and some secondary readings; we may also read some
contemporary aesthetic theory.  Choice of readings will to some extent
be determined by the interests of the students participating.  The
class will be conducted as a seminar, and participants will be
expected to participate actively in discussion.  Requirements will
include several short writing assignments and a long final paper;
participation in class discussion will be taken into account in
determining the final grade.Enrollment in the class is limited to 15 and is by application only.
To apply to enroll, you should send an email  (with “Philosophy 187
Application” in the subject line) to the instructor at
ginsborg@berkeley.edu with a brief description of your reasons for
wishing to take the course and a description of your background in
philosophy, including, but not necessarily limited to, a list of
philosophy courses already taken and the corresponding grades.
Participants will be expected to have a substantial background in
philosophy.  Preference will be given to philosophy majors, and,

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will be a detailed examination of several central works of 
the 17th century philosopher G.W. Leibniz, with an emphasis on his 
metaphysical views.Topics will include Leibniz’s views on the relation 
between mind and body, the nature of space and time, the relation 
between our representations of the world and the world as it is in 
itself, the nature of substance and material reality, the relation 
between God and creation, the nature of inter- and intra-substantial 
causality, and the unity of organic entities.Enrollment in the class is limited to 20 and is restricted to philosophy

Promising can be understood as a device for generating new obligations where there were none before, a device whose operations help us to coordinate our activities and to make effective plans for the future. But how exactly do promises function? Do promissory obligations result from our participation in beneficial social practices, or do they derive instead from the effects of the promise on the attitudes of the promisee? Can promises be binding even if nobody expects you to fulfill them? Promises seem to involve obligations that are directional, insofar as they are owed specifically to the promisee; but is this an idea that we can make good sense of? How do promises function in the law (what is the relation between promises and contracts?), and in the context of intimate personal relationships? What human interests ultimately ground the kind of “normative powers” that promising confers on agents?The seminar will involve close study of some of the most important contributions to the extensive contemporary literature on promising. Philosophers whose works will be discussed include Raz, Scanlon, Thomson, Shiffrin, and Owens (among others).Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world.  There are five units in the course:
Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism)
Personal Identity
Functionalism
Consciousness
Causation
The books required for the course are:
David Chalmers (ed.), Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002).
John Perry (ed.), Personal Identity (Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press 1975).What is the mind?  Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world?  And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain?   We shall begin the course by looking at these fundamental questions about the nature of the psychological.
What is a person?  Is a person merely a biological entity, and the identity of a person just the identity of a physical thing?  Do psychological states enter into the identity of the self, or can we explain the continued existence of the self in terms that do not appeal to psychological states?  And what is the importance of personal identity?  Recently some theorists have argued that we should give it much less weight than we seem to ordinarily; we will look at those arguments.
One of the most powerful ideas in contemporary philosophy of mind is functionalism, the idea that the character of a mental state is constituted by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior.  In the third unit we look at the strengths and limitations of this idea.
One limitation of functionalism is its trouble in providing an analysis of consciousness.  What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain?  Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms?  We will try to identify the aspects of conscious experience that make it difficult to explain this characteristic of the mental life in physicalist terms.
In one way or another, throughout this course we will be going over the relation of the psychological life to the physical.  Finally, we will look at how psychological states can be said to have causes and effects.  Do we in fact ordinarily take it that psychological states do have causes and effects?  And can they do so, if the whole causal story of the world can be told entirely in terms of physics?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is a course about the use of probability in epistemology. Probability imports assumptions about and imposes constraints on any subject matter you use it to describe. Some of these constraints are well-known, but their implications are not always known or observed. In others it is an open question how much leeway probability allows. We discuss the fate of holism, foundationalism, empiricism, introspective access, self-knowledge, belief in logical truth, and closure of knowledge under known implication. under a probabilistic description. We consider the consequences of the globality of the P function and of extreme probabilities. We discuss artifacts of representation and how to think about idealization in philosophy. Idealizations are false models, so how can one be better than another, or any of them illuminating?Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaI think many, indeed most, of the philosophic confusions about perception come from a failure to understand the intentionality of perceptual experience.  Many philosophers deny that perception has intentionality, and even those who accept it tend to give a false account of the intentionality.  A correct account will not only enable us to give an adequate account of perceptual experiences but to refute the standard mistakes in the field, such as phenomenalism, the representative theory, disjunctivism, etc.
     This subject obviously opens up into a whole lot of related subjects in epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind, and I intend to pursue several of those.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIssues in the philosophy of history from Kant, Hegel, and Marx to Foucault.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA beginning exploration of some interrelated questions concerning the conditions of propositional thought: understanding, a capacity for judgement and for believing and doing things for reasons, and how knowledge of what is so and one’s knowledge of oneself are or are not involved in the competent exercise of such capacities.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will discuss some of the central themes of Kant’s metaphysics and epistemology by closely examining the argument of the “Transcendental Deduction of the Categories” and related texts in the Critique of Pure Reason and the Prolegomena, as well as some of the relevant secondary literature.  The topics in Kant that I plan to cover include consciousness and apperception, the unity of the self, the character of conceptual representation, the notions of a category, of judgment, and of the form of a judgment, and the concept of an object.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPlease note:  As taught this semester Phil 114 
 will satisfy the ethics requirement.Political science seeks to describe, explain, and predict political 
phenomena. These questions must be settled empirically: by consulting 
history, observing differences between countries, conducting 
statistical studies, and so on. Political philosophy asks different 
questions, which it is less clear that we can settle empirically. 
Some of these questions are conceptual. What makes a particular form 
of human interaction political? Other questions are normative. What 
sort of government should we have? How should we, as individuals, 
relate to it?This course will survey some major works of political philosophy of 
the 17th-19th centuries.  More specifically, we will read several, 
but not all, of the following authors: Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, 
 Hume, Bentham, Mill, Kant, Hegel, and Marx.  The selection remains to 
be determined.The course will be more interpretive than many philosophy classes. 
Although we may hope to learn something about the questions that 
interest us, we will be discussing, in the first instance, the 
questions that interested the authors. Furthermore, our 
 interpretations will have a different focus from courses on the same 
texts in other departments. There will be greater emphasis on 
normative foundations than on institutional design, and greater 
emphasis on the internal logical structure of the arguments than on 
their author’s rhetoric or immediate political aims. For this reason, 
some experience with philosophical reasoning is essential.Previously taught:

We will follow in detail how in the West polytheism gradually became more and more monolithic until everything was understood in relation to a single God, and then how this synthesis fell apart and left our culture with a choice between nihilism or a return to polytheism.

An introduction to moral and political philosophy, the course considers some of the ethical controversies associated with our racially, economically, and culturally diverse contemporary societies, including: the ethics of multiculturalism, feminism, and affirmative action; the regulation of hate speech; how to meet the needs of extremely poor people; and the nature of tolerance.  Readings are drawn from contemporary philosophy and include works by Peter Singer, Bernard Williams, T.M. Scanlon, G.A. Cohen, and Susan Wolf.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to the philosophical study of the mind. We
will start off by investigating the Mind-Body problem: that is, how
exactly are the mind and body related to one another? Are they two wholly
separate things? Or is the mind just identical to the brain?
Alternatively, the mind might just be a computer program, with the
implication that machines could be capable of thought and other mental
states. We will study the strong and weak points of all of these theories:
Dualism, Identity Theory, Behaviorism and Functionalism. We will go on to
look at the phenomenon of consciousness. We will ask: what is
consciousness? Can we describe it scientifically? What is special about
the conscious states that we refer to as “emotions”? We will end the
course by studying how we should regard the content of our mental states.
In essence, we will try to see if content is internally or externally
determined. How much does the environment in which we are placed get into
our heads? Again, the overarching theme and goal of this question, as well
as all the others, will be a deeper understanding of how our minds and the
physical world around us are related.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhen you encounter (or assert) a conclusion that is supposed to follow
from some premises, it is often helpful to know why (and whether) the
conclusion really does follow from the premises—why (and whether) the
argument with that conclusion and those premises is valid. In this
course, you will develop the skills to tell, for many different
arguments, why the conclusion does or does not follow from the premises.
In particular, you will learn how to translate many arguments in English
into a formal language (such as the Language of Sentential Logic or the
Language of First-Order Logic), how to test whether some of those
arguments are valid (for example, using truth tables for arguments in
the Language of Sentential Logic), and how to demonstrate the validity
(by constructing a proof in a natural deduction system) or invalidity
(by constructing a counterexample) of any argument in one of our formal
languages.Previously taught:

Those new to philosophy will learn the landscape by reading and writing about knowledge (epistemology), the nature of reality (metaphysics), psychology, philosophy of mind, politics, and ethics as the ancients saw it.  Those with experience in philosophy will get acquainted both with the striking differences between ancient and modern thinkers and the very elements that make the Greeks foundational to Western philosophy. The ancient perspective is an excellent starting point for its accessibility to the newcomer and inextricable relation to ongoing philosophical debates.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will survey the ideas of five important philosophers of
the 17th and 18th century – Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and
Kant. We will consider how they pose and develop responses to
important metaphysical and epistemological questions that form the
basis of some of the main concerns of modern philosophy. These include
questions about the nature of reality (Does God exist? What is the

classical China, including Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism.
Although the course is meant primarily as a survey of the most important
Chinese thinkers, a prominent theme will be their views on moral
cultivation and moral agency. Philosophers of this era were greatly
interested in the development of good character and the key features of
proper moral knowledge and motivation. All Chinese texts will be in

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will be a broad introduction to some of the important issues in moral and political philosophy.  We will address central questions in each of the three major subject areas of ethics.  We will start with metaethics, and ask questions about the nature of morality.  For example: Is there any such thing as moral truth, or are all moral statements only personally or culturally relative?  Then we will discuss questions in normative ethics about the content of morality: What makes right actions right?  How do our various duties relate to one another (for example, is there only one supreme duty, from which all the others can be derived)?  Finally, we will address some of the more explicitly practical questions in applied ethics.  For example: What are our duties to those suffering from famine in far-off lands?  Is abortion ever morally permissible?  How should we treat non-human animals; for example, can we permissibly eat them?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to truth-functional and quantificational logic.  Logic is the study of good and bad arguments (pieces of reasoning).  In a deductively good argument, the conclusion follows from the assumptions: if all assumptions are true, the conclusion is guaranteed to be true as well.  The deductive goodness of an important class of arguments rests on patterns in the way these arguments use notions such as not, and, or, if, all and some.  We will represent such patterns symbolically, and give a precise account of which patterns ensure deductive goodness and which do not.   In addition, we will introduce systems of rules for constructing deductively good arguments.  Besides becoming better at formulating and evaluating deductive arguments, students will gain an understanding of central logical concepts such as validity, implication, consistency, equivalence, soundness, and completeness.Textbook: Virginia Klenk, Understanding Symbolic Logic, 4th edition (Prentice Hall, 2002).Previously taught:

period: Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. We will study
their work in the areas of metaphysics and epistemology and trace the
development of particular philosophical problems and insights through each

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis introductory class will examine the works of four classical protagonists of Western political thought – Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, and John Rawls. It is meant to provide students with a basic understanding of paradigmatic ancient, modern, and contemporary political theories: An understanding of the respective metaphysical and ontological, rationalist and contractarian approaches that essentially inform these theories; of the underlying anthropological assumptions; of the relevance and specific meaning of concepts such as justice, freedom, or power; and, most importantly, of differing argumentative strategies of justifying the existence of the state philosophically. Thus, based on a careful reading of their politico-philosophical writings, it is to be considered how Plato and Aristotle, Hobbes and Rawls aim at finding a balance that resolves the inescapable tension between (stately) authority and (individual) autonomy. Additionally, the course aims at identifying the concepts of the political that, implicitly or explicitly, organize the political theories discussed.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHumans, and possibly certain other creatures, are conscious. Life would
have no personal meaning, it wouldn’t matter one bit (to each of us
individually, at any rate), if it were not for consciousness. But what is
consciousness? Does possession of consciousness require possession of a
non-physical soul or does mind = brain in which case it will eventually be
explained by neuroscience? Did some deity endow us with consciousness or
is consciousness just one quirky outcome of the blind force of evolution
by natural selection? Does my possession of a mind equip me with a free
will that allows for personal responsibility, as well as blame and praise,
for my actions? If my mind is just my brain then in what sense, am I free
— the brain after all is just a 3 lb. piece of tissue and biology is
thought to be governed by natural laws. Indeed, some have suggested that
the idea of free will is an illusion.The course will introduce students to the main problems in the philosophy
of mind: the nature of consciousness, the mind-body relation, free-will
vs. determinism, the nature of personal identity. Nothing less that the
meaning of life and the nature of morality rest on our understanding of
our minds. No prior background in philosophy is required. Students
interested in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, medicine, religion,
and law will find much to interest them.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA survey of the major philosophers of the modern period (17th and 18th centuries):  Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Kant.  The defining characteristic of philosophy in this period was the rejection of Aristotelian philosophy as developed in the Scholastic tradition and the rise of a new mathematical/mechanical philosophy of nature (the so-called Scientific Revolution, whose major figures include Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Boyle, and Newton).  We will focus on such metaphysical and epistemological issues as:  the nature of substance, causation, space and time, identity (including personal identity), the relation between mind and body, the existence, attributes, and providence of God, skepticism about the external world,  induction,  and the structure  and limits of scientific explanation.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of 
psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical 
world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, 
Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, 
Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? 
Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, 
characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations 
of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely 
physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a 
person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? 
Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations 
with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between 
conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and 
above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it 
somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability 
to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be 
explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.Previously taught:

It provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek philosophical thinking from the pre-Socratic beginnings to the hellenistic period. The bulk of the course will be spent on the analysis of the philosophical motives, methods and views of Socrates (469 – 399 BC), Plato (427-347 BC), and Aristotle (384-322 BC). Since the ancient Greeks identified many of the philosophical problems (and models for their resolution) we are still concerned with today, the course may also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaNote:  As taught this semester, Philosophy 108 will satisfy the Ethics requirement.As a thoughtful person, living in this country, at this time, you have at some point asked yourself some of the following questions.
Should torture be allowed? Is there any difference between terrorism and “collateral damage”? May we kill enemy soldiers or even civilians to protect ourselves? Is capital punishment moral? Is abortion? Whether or not it’s moral, should it be legal? Should we let the majority or the courts decide? Is the government allowed to take your money and use it in ways you don’t want? If you have better grades and higher test scores, do you deserve a spot at UC more? Are you allowed to buy yourself an iPod when you could use the money to save people from starving? Should you buy a hybrid, rather than an SUV, when your individual choice is just “a drop in the bucket” and won’t really affect global warming?These questions can be difficult for many different reasons. Self- interest, prejudice, and fear can cloud our judgment. Religious authorities that we accept on faith, such as the Bible, can give unclear or conflicting directions. Finally, it can be hard to be sure of relevant facts: for example, whether information gained through torture tends to be reliable, whether the justice system applies the death penalty consistently, or whether burning fossil fuels leads to climate change.This course, however, is about another set of difficulties, which persist when we set aside our personal feelings, we see how far we can get without relying on faith, and we assume that we know the relevant facts. We may not be able to decide, by our own reflection and reasoning, which answers are correct, and even when we are sure that certain answers are correct, we may not be able to justify them. Our ethical ideas may seem not up to the task. Our aim in this course is to come to terms with these difficulties and to see to what extent they can be overcome.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein. We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege and Russell.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe philosophy of perception is a microcosm of the metaphysics of mind. Its central problems – What is perception? What is the nature of perceptual consciousness? How can one fit an account of perceptual experience into a broader account of the nature of the mind and the world? – are problems at the heart of metaphysics. It is often justifiably said that the theory of perception (and especially vision) is the area of psychology and neuroscience that has made the greatest progress in recent years. Despite this progress, or perhaps because of it, philosophical problems about perception retain a great urgency, both for philosophy and for science.Previously taught:

Because he viewed the traditional understanding of this concept as fatally superficial and misguided, his plan was to work out a new fundamental ontology. Its design was (1) to uncover the true meaning of being on the basis of temporality as its transcendental horizon and (2) to point out the crucial steps in the tradition (Aristotle, Descartes and Kant) that led to the misconception. Heidegger never finished this ambitious project, but the work’s first published part Being and Time (1927) still counts as one of the most challenging and important works of the 20th century. The course will focus on the connection between the question of being, the analysis of human nature, and the phenomenological method that Heidegger presents as the necessary foundation of his project in Division I of Being and Time. We will also cover the first three chapters of Division II including the analysis of death, conscience, resoluteness and Dasein’s authentic potentiality for being ‘whole’.Participants are required to give one short presentation (10-15 minutes, including a brief hand-out) and to write a final paper of 15 pages at the end of the semester.Text to be used: Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, translated by John Macquarrie/Edward Robinson, paperback reprint 2008, Harper Perennial Modern Thought Series.

force ever be used without consent?  May force ever be used for ends other
than to respond to (e.g., defend against or punish) uses of force?  Is
there some difference between states and individuals that licenses states
to use force where individuals would be forbidden from using force?  Do
democracies, or states enjoying “the rule of law,” have better title to
use force?We will touch on a number of bordering topics in moral and political
philosophy: the nature and value of freedom, property and contracts,
liberalism and libertarianism, democratic theory, the justification of
self-defense and punishment, and the limits of the criminal law.We will begin with A. J. Simmons, John Rawls, and Joshua Cohen, and then
turn to more recent work by Philip Pettit, Arthur Ripstein, Japa
Pallikkathayil, and A.J. Julius.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar explores connection between social welfare and individual
preferences.  What bearing does preference satisfaction have on
well-being?  Which normative principles are important to respect in social
distributions, and how are these principles represented in formal theories
about determining social welfare?  In particular, we will consider how
equality matters to the value of a social distribution; and whether a
social distribution should respect Pareto optimality, the idea that if
everyone prefers x to y then x is socially preferred to y.  We will also
consider the question of how interpersonal considerations in picking a
social distribution relate to individual considerations in picking a
gamble, and the question of what individual preferences in decision-making
under risk reveal about social preferences.  Finally, we will consider the
distribution of value over time.This course is intended for graduate students in philosophy, but advanced
undergraduates may enroll with permission.  No background in decision,
game, or social choice theory is required, but a general facility with
technical material is assumed.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe seminar is principally concerned with framing and developing philosophical accounts of perception in response to the arguments from illusion and hallucination. The issues to be discussed fall into three broad topics:Object, Experience & Content: Framing the Problem(1)    Direct v Indirect Perception: What is the basis of this distinction in the traditional debate, how does this map on to concerns with sensory awareness and sense experience?(2)    Sensation & the Argument from Illusion: What picture of sense experience derives from a sense-datum account of sensory illusion? How does this inform a representational or intentional theory of perception?(3)   Intentionality & the Causal Argument: How does the Causal Argument, or the Argument from Hallucination, constrain the options for a theory of sense experience?Why be so Naïve? Reasons for a Relational Approach to Sensory Awareness(4)    Intentional v Relational pictures of sensory awareness I: the case of singular thought; applications to the particularity of sensory awareness & episodic memory(5)    Two-level approaches to phenomenal episodes: embedding sense experience – sensory imagination & episodic memory; explanatory challenge to intentional accounts.Disjunctivism: Formulation & Consequences(6)    Saving Appearances: disjunctivism as a response to the Causal Argument; the minimal form of disjunctivism so motivated; application of notions of indiscriminability to the case; consequences for non-transitivity of just noticeable difference; particularity of sensory awareness; impossible perception.(7)    Inner Awareness & Outer Knowledge: the unacceptability of disjunctivism concerning appearances, and differing views of our access to the inner realm.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaJohn Rawls radically altered the ways in which philosophers think about the question ‘How should we live together?’ when he published A Theory of Justice in 1971. Few philosophers would question that this work is the most ambitious and influential work on political philosophy produced during the twentieth century.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is a seminar on art and human nature. What is art? Why does it matter to us? What does it tell us about ourselves?We begin with a survey and critical examination of approaches to art that make use of methods and ideas from neuroscience. This approach, which is sometimes called “neuroaesthetics,” is increasingly popular not only in neuroscience, but also in fields of art (such as painting and choreography), as well in art history and criticism. We will also consider writings about art that draw heavily on Darwinian evolution (so-called “evolutionary psychology”). In the next part of the course, we will turn to new work that treats art as an “organizational practice.” This new approach holds out the promise of a more plausible account of art, its importance, and the origins of art in human biology. Art, according to this new approach, is a kind of philosophy (and philosophy is a kind of art).Our discussions will range over different fields, with special consideration of choreography, picture-making arts, writing, and the nature of technology.This is a graduate-level philosophy seminar, however students with different backgrounds will be welcome (but only with the instructor’s approval). Students will be required to write a term paper on a topic to be developed with the instructor.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this seminar we will read (in translation) Plato’s dialogue the Sophist, a central work for his later metaphysics and philosophy of language. Major themes include: the definition of sophistry; the nature of being and non-being; the possibility of false statement and false belief. We will also look at a selection of recent work on the dialogue by authors such as Brown, Crivelli, Gill, and Leigh.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaOnce conceived as a single formal system, epistemic logic has become a general
formal approach to the study of the structure of knowledge, its limits and
possibilities, and its static and dynamic properties.  Recently there has been a
resurgence of interest in the relation between epistemic logic and epistemology.
Some of the new applications of epistemic logic in epistemology go beyond the
traditional limits of the logic of knowledge, either by modeling the dynamic
process of knowledge acquisition or by modifying the representation of epistemic
states to reflect different theories of knowledge. In this seminar, we will
explore a number of topics at the intersection of epistemic logic and
epistemology, centered around epistemic closure, higher-order knowledge, and
paradoxes of knowability.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar is an introduction to the problem of free will, i.e. the problem of how to justify our belief that we are free to choose between alternative courses of action. In the first half of the semester we will look at the history of the problem, paying special attention to its origins in antiquity. In the second half of the semester we will turn to the lively contemporary debate. Questions to be considered include: When and why did concerns about free will emerge? What does free will consist in? Is it possible for us to act freely if our behavior is determined by factors beyond our control? Is human freedom compatible with the existence of an omniscient God? What is the relation of free will to moral responsibility and to ethics?Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is a course on the nature of mind. The central question we ask: Can we give an account of the mind within the framework of natural science? We will read widely in philosophy and cognitive science as we seek to answer this fundamental question. Among the topics we will cover: the nature of consciousness, the possibility of machine minds, neuroscience as the basic science of human experience, our knowledge of each other.Previously taught:

For example, does God exist? Should we believe in God? Are there such things as souls, and if so, how do they interact with the physical body? How should a just God punish us for our moral wrongdoing? Finally, is morality based on God’s commands?

views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza,
Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the
existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the
body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the
nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics.
We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific
developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which
supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But
we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in
their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy.  We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as influential work by important contemporary philosophers (including Korsgaard, Nagel, Scanlon, and Williams).  Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)?  Why should we care about complying with moral demands?  What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)?  Is there anything interesting that we can say, in general terms, about what makes actions morally right or wrong?Previously taught:

What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a
picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is
performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human
nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these
and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a
range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century).Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled
Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA lecture-and-discussion course on the nature and prospects of metaphysical understanding of the world.  Does metaphysics seek a conception of what is really so or how things really are independently of all the ways we think of or experience them?  What, if anything, can be discovered about such a world?  How are conclusions about it to be reached?  We will concentrate on questions about the independent metaphysical reality of (1) the colors of things (2) the relation of cause and effect (2) the necessity with which certain things must be so (4) the goodness or badness or other evaluative qualities of things.Familiarity with the history of modern philosophy (especially Hume and Kant) will be taken for granted.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments?  What is the nature of perception?  This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.Previously taught:

of language and thought. By virtue of what are some things in the world
(for example, sentences and thoughts) about others? Is meaning always a
matter of interpretation, or do some things have meaning independently
of interpretation? Is conceptual thought prior to language? What would
it take for a computer to have thoughts? Are the meanings of our words
and the contents of our mental states determined by what’s going on
inside our brains, or do they depend also on features of our physical
and social environments? Could there be facts about meaning we could
only discover by looking in someone’s brain? Are there objective facts
about meaning at all? In exploring these and related questions, we will
read the work of Quine, Davidson, Grice, Putnam, Dennett, Searle, Burge,

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course deals with applications of game theory and rational choice theory to philosophical problems, as well as with paradoxes and problems introduced by these theories. After introducing the basic concepts of game theory, the first part of the course will be devoted to problems of cooperation and convention: how people manage to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit, e.g. drive on the same side of the road, carry out a project together, or use language. The next section will explore non-cooperative games, such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma; the possible application of these games to moral problems; and the need for and execution of a social contract. Finally, we turn to problems dealing with groups, such as the problem of collective action, and some issues in group decision making.Previously taught:

In particularly, our focus will be on the epistemological and metaphysical topics in the Phenomenology of Spirit and in the Science of Logic. However, we will also discuss some aspects of Hegel’s practical philosophy, in particular the theory of action in the Philosophy of Right. Topics will include: the relationship of epistemology to skepticism, the contrast between self-consciousness and self-knowledge, Hegel’s concept of truth, and Hegel’s theory of action.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe theory of knowledge or epistemology is concerned with questions such as: How is knowledge possible? What forms of knowledge are there? Can “knowledge” be defined? Can we know that we know anything whatsoever? In this course we will set out from a variety of skeptical problems, that is, problems resulting in paradoxes, which seem to prove that we cannot know anything. We will then discuss various responses to skeptical paradoxes. In the last part of the course, we will concentrate on some prominent analyses of “knowledge” and discuss whether an analysis of “knowledge” is feasible. In this context, we will also look at various contemporary responses to the problem of justification, which identifies justification as the problematic ingredient in our understanding of knowledge.

On closer analysis though, many of Nietzsche’s central theses can be understood properly only against the background of  Schopenhauer’s thought.The course offers a comparative study of both philosophers’ interpretations of life and human existence. Topics to be studied include their accounts of the role of art and the function of aesthetic experience; the nature of the drives (will); the relation between the intellectual ego and the bodily self; and the diagnoses and evaluation of nihilism. Readings from Schopenhauer’s philosophy will be drawn mostly from his famous The World as Will and Representation. The relevant works by Nietzsche span the different phases of his philosophy. We will concentrate on key selections from The Birth of the Tragedy, The Gay Science, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, The Genealogy of Morals and his posthumously published late notes (Will to Power). The course is intended for junior and senior philosophy majors.

We will read Phenomenology of Perception in order to understand and evaluate Merleau-Ponty’s arguments against what he calls empiricism (a sort of behaviorism) and intellectualism (Cognitivism), as well as his positive account of what he calls motor intentionality  – a kind of intentionality without conceptual content that, Merleau-Ponty argues, is the basic way human beings are embedded in the world.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn his New Essays on Human Understanding, the rationalist philosopher Gottfried Leibniz offers a point by point critique of Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding.  Locke’s Essay contains extensive discussion of the “origin, certainty and extent of human knowledge,” which he uses to address problems in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of religion.  In this course we will examine Leibniz’s New Essays with the central goal of understanding the key points of difference between Leibniz’s rationalist epistemological and metaphysical views and Locke’s empiricist philosophical views.
While our central text will be Leibniz’s New Essays, we will supplement this with readings from Locke’s Essay, as well as other readings from Leibniz’s philosophical writings.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will be looking at recent work on perception, from both philosophy and psychology.  In particular, we’ll be looking at work on visual attention, and trying to gauge what impact this work should have on what we say about visual experience.  This has implications for a number of philosophical problems.  Conscious attention seems to be demanded by the role of vision in providing grasp of concepts of the objects and properties around us, and in generating propositional knowledge of our surroundings.  Conscious attention also seems to be required for intentional action on our surroundings.  If there’s time, we’ll also look at recent philosophical and empirical work on Molyneux’s Question.We’ll go on to look at some perceptual disorders, in particular, perceptual disorders in schizophrenia.  We’ll review the phenomenon of intentional binding (a certain compression in your experience of time between your action and its outcome), and how this seems to be different in schizophrenic patients.  We’ll also look at some of the perceptual hallucinations and delusions characteristic of schizophrenia.Finally, we’ll consider the role of perception in an understanding of the first person:  an understanding of how to use ‘I’ and related terms.  Classically, Descartes held that your understanding of ‘I’ does not at all depend on your ability to perceive your surroundings.  We’ll discuss whether the Cogito does establish this, and at different pictures of the role perception might play in establishing one’s own existence.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe main purpose of this course is to answer the question “How does language relate to the world?” In order to do this we will have to explore a lot of related questions, such as those concerning the nature of truth, reference, meaning, speech acts, metaphors, fiction, and pictures. We will also try to develop a general theoretical account of how human linguistic behavior is related to the rest of human behavior and to human mental states.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAristotle’s science of living beings contains a joint or “common” account of animal and human locomotion. At the center of this common account lies a certain conception of animal and human agency, which also forms the basis for Aristotle’s accounts of moral responsibility, of morally good action and akratic behavior. The seminar aims at a philosophical evaluation of this conception. Sections from the following books will be read and discussed: Physics VIII; De Anima III; De Motu Animalium; Nicomachean Ethics III, VI, VII.Requirements: Phil. 161 or equivalent. Knowledge of Greek is welcome, but not required.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaI think many, indeed most, of the philosophical confusions about perception come from a failure to understand the intentionality of perceptual experience. Many philosophers deny that perception has intentionality, and even those who accept it tend to give a false account of the intentionality. A correct account will not only enable us to give an adequate account of perceptual experiences but to refute the standard mistakes in the field, such as phenomenalism, the representative theory, disjunctivism, etc.This subject obviously opens up into a whole lot of related subjects in epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind, and I intend to pursue several of those.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will look at some recent work in metaethics, focusing on questions about reasons for action and (practical) normativity, which have attracted a very lively contemporary discussion. Issues to be discussed include the objectivity of reasons; the connections between reasons and rational agency; the naturalistic challenge to normativity; the prospects for understanding discourse about reasons without postulating normative facts or truths; and the relations between reasons for action and the agent’s desires.Works to be discussed include recent contributions by Blackburn, Parfit, Raz, Scanlon, Street, Thomson, and others.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaResearch in social psychology has exploded over the past 30 or so
years, generating powerful new methods of measurement and a broad
range of surprising and sometimes downright puzzling findings.  But
while philosophers have taken a keen interest in other areas within
the “mind/brain sciences” (such as, e.g., perception, consciousness,
language, reasoning, moral psychology, and action), social psychology
has been largely neglected.  This course will examine how recent
findings in social psychology speak to perennial questions in mind,
ethics, and political philosophy, including the nature of freedom,
moral responsibility, self-knowledge, belief, desire, emotion, and
prejudice.  We will also take a critical look at the methods,
presuppositions, and theories of contemporary social psychology “on
its own terms,” i.e., considered apart from its relevance to
traditional philosophical issues.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

If so, what is the nature of this difference and what are its moral, social, and political implications?  If not, what explains the apparent differences?  How do considerations of race, class, religion, and nationality speak to these questions?  Can a psychological account of how we tend to sort people into distinct social categories illuminate how we understand these categories?  Can assumptions about gender compromise the science of gender and sex, or scientific objectivity in general?  This course introduces philosophy students to these and related questions in feminist thought, concluding with analyses of a few specific debates in contemporary feminist epistemology, ethics, and metaphysics.Required Readings:All other readings and assigned material will be available on bSpace.Course Grading and Requirements: Participation (20%); Papers (80%)Attendance & Participation (20%): This includes attendance, participation, and pop quizzes.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course has two parts. Part One (first 10 weeks) will be more technical in nature. It will involve learning some of the key metalogical results for first-order logic (e.g., soundness, completeness, and compactness). The goal will be to get through Parts 1-3 of Hunter’s Metalogic textbook, which concludes with a famous metalogical paradox
called “Skolem’s Paradox”. Part Two (last 5 weeks) will be more philosophical in nature. It will involve investigating the historical impact (on 20th century analytic philosophy) of the metalogical results covered in Part One of the course. For instance, we will discuss the influence of “Skolem’s Paradox” on the philosophical development of W.V.O. Quine and Hilary Putnam.Prerequisites.

We will focus on such topics as the purpose of the Metaphysical Foundations and its account of the need for a grounding for natural science, the relation between the Metaphysical Foundations and the Critique, the role of mathematics in natural science, the contrast between relative and absolute motion, the status of absolute space, the notions of substance and causation, the account of force and the contrast between the mechanical and dynamical theory of matter, and the notions of inertia and of the communication of motion.  Alongside the primary texts by Kant, we will be spending much of the semester reading Michael Friedman’s forthcoming book, Kant’s Construction of Nature. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will focus on conceptions of friendship as well as related notions like family and love in Chinese and Western philosophy and literature. On the Chinese side we will read texts ascribed to Confucius and Zhuangzi, among others, as well as those by contemporary writers.  On the Western side we will concern ourselves with writings by Plato and Aristotle, as well as by a number of contemporary authors. Our interest is both in the question how friendship is understood and practiced and in the question of the special moral considerations to which it gives rise.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPhilosophy 112.  Special Topics in Aesthetics: Music and MeaningInstructors:  Hannah Ginsborg (Philosophy), Mary Ann Smart (Music).This course will explore the question of whether music has meaning, and if so, what kind. Can music represent, say, birdsong, or the sea, or merely imitate? If music expresses emotions, then whose–those of the listener? the composer? the performer? We will consider parallels and contrasts between linguistic and musical meaning, theories of how music can be expressive, and the question of whether music can convey political meaning. The course will be taught as a seminar, and students will be expected to participate actively. Each week’s discussion will be structured around the interaction between musical excerpts and readings, drawn from historical and contemporary literature in philosophy, musicology, and the psychology of music. Requirements will include several short papers, a class presentation, and a final paper.   Please note that this course is being taught as part of the “Big Ideas” breadth program; for details of the program, see http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/.

between factual and evaluative language.  When we say that Jim is
being cruel, or that he should not pull the cat’s tail, they hold, we
are not saying how things are, but expressing our disapproval and trying
to influence others. This view has major consequences for how we think
about moral and aesthetic argument and disagreements.  In this seminar,
we will consider the motivations for thinking that evaluative language
is nonfactual, and we will look at some difficulties that arise in
working out the idea.  Readings will be drawn mostly from twentieth
century analytic philosophers.This is a proseminar, which means that the format of the class will be
different from most classes in our department. I will not lecture.
Instead, we will try to come to grips with the texts by discussing them
collaboratively.  Participation and occasional presentations are
expected.  It is essential that you do the reading and think hard
about it before each class.This is an upper-level philosophy course.  Students should be philosophy
majors and must have taken at least two prior philosophy courses.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to moral and political philosophy. We will
consider a range of ethical issues regarding individual conduct as well as
social arrangements, policies, and practices. We will begin by considering
whether there are objective ethical truths, examining several arguments
for the view that ethics is not objective as well as responses to those
arguments. Next we will consider what, if anything, well-off individuals
are obligated to do to aid the very poor. We will then examine the ethics
of meat consumption, abortion, and euthanasia. Next we will look at two
influential views of distributive justice, and consider whether equality
is a moral ideal that we should endorse and seek to achieve. We will then
examine the ethics of affirmative action, and the issues of free speech,
tolerance, and multiculturalism. We will conclude by considering some
ethical issues regarding war and terrorism.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe digest, we scrape our knees, our toenails grow. From this perspective we seem to be physical creatures in a physical world. But we also see the red of the tomato, we feel the pangs of longing, our humor is stoked by the nice delivery of a joke. We have a conscious mental life the variety and quality of which is difficult to put into words. From this perspective
it may seem very difficult to see ourselves are merely physical organisms. So the problem is this: can both of these perspectives be accounted for within a coherent and broadly natural theory of the mind?Towards an answer to this question we will study the mind from a
philosophical point of view. Our primary question will be: what is the relation between the mind and the physical world? Is the mind part of the physical world? Is our mental life just another physical processes like digestion? Or is it rather that the mind is non-physical in nature and hence that it cannot be accounted for in physical terms?The study of these questions will involve us with dualism, physicalism, the identity theory, behaviorism, functionalism, the problem of consciousness, personal identity, the neural correlates of consciousness and other related issues. We will read Putnam, Descartes, Hume, Chalmers, Smart, Turing, Nagel, Jackson and others.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is a gentle introduction to symbolic logic. Most generally,
we’ll be investigating the concept of logical consequence, roughly, the
notion that certain claims follow from certain other ones in virtue of
their logical form. To try to sharpen our understanding of this concept
and
various related ones, we’ll learn a new formal language—the language of
first-order logic—in stages. At each stage, we’ll make sense of logical
concepts in terms of the truth values of sentences in the new language. In
addition, we’ll learn a useful method for demonstrating that sentences in
the language are logical consequences of others: natural deduction proofs
in a Fitch-style system.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will provide an introduction to the history of philosophy and
to philosophical thinking in general. Students new to the subject will
acquire a crucial foundation for further study in philosophy or related
subjects, while students with more experience will develop a sense of
different approaches to familiar problems. We will examine the beginnings
of philosophy in ancient Greece and trace some of its developments over
the course of antiquity. At the same time, we will try to understand what
ancient Greeks took to be philosophical problems in areas ranging from the
nature of what exists and the knowledge of it to questions of how each
person should live and how people should live together. We will also
explore how those problems resonate with concerns of modern philosophers.
The course will begin with early Greek philosophy, then focus primarily on
Plato and Aristotle, and conclude with a brief treatment of the
philosophical schools that grew up after Aristotle.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries).  This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years.  Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined.  The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled.By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries.  Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally.  Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy.  It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind?  What are the limits of human knowledge?  What is a person?  What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy.  In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy.  For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.Previously taught:

In the first part of the course (“Fundamentals”) we will discuss two notions that play a central role in logical theory: truth and validity. We will pay special attention to the philosophical significance of Tarski’s formal definitions of both notions. In the second part (“Applications”) we will look at applications of logical theory to two philosophical problems: the sorites paradox (or “paradox of the heap”) and the problem of future contingents. In grappling with these problems we will learn about many-valued logics, modal operators, supervaluations, and the logic of indexicals, and we will bring to bear our earlier, more abstract discussions of truth and validity.
Prerequisites: I will not presuppose any knowledge of logic beyond what is taught in Philosophy 12A. In addition to 12A, you must have taken at least one other course in philosophy.
Requirements will include both papers and occasional problem sets.Readings: John Etchemendy, The Concept of Logical Consequence; Timothy Williamson, Vagueness; course reader.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat is the mind?

What is a mind? What are mental states such as beliefs and desires and perceptions? Should we explain what they are in terms of behavior, their connections to other mental states or the way it feels to be in that mental state?  How is the mind related to the body? What is consciousness? Is there room for consciousness within a scientific worldview? What must our mental states be like if they are to allow for genuine knowledge of the external world?

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn the modern era, a tradition of philosophers and artists began to
question the meaning-giving status of social custom, and eventually of
rationality and religion. The breakdown of rational and religious
authority raises the threat of nihilism, the total absence of meaning or
value. It also calls for a new kind of thinking, a new vocabulary and an
alternative to rational argumentation to find meaning independently of God
or reason. This course follows the development of existentialism from its
religious beginnings in Pascal and Kierkegaard, through Dostoyevsky’s
masterpiece The Brothers Karamazov and Nietzsche’s atheistic affirmation
of life, and into the 20th century.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaLogic is about reasoning.  People reason well or reason poorly; people’s arguments are good or bad.  Logic is concerned with telling the difference; specifically, we will look at formal systems for characterizing and evaluating the structure of arguments.  A good, or valid, deductive argument is one in which the conclusion follows from the premises—one in which true premises would guarantee a true conclusion.  Our study of formal systems will yield methods for figuring out when arguments are valid.This class is in many ways like a math class: the work will primarily involve doing logic problems.  It should, however, give you a greater appreciation for the structure of arguments in ordinary English.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis introductory class will examine the works of four classical protagonists of Western political thought – Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, and John Rawls. It is meant to provide students with a basic understanding of paradigmatic ancient, early-modern, and contemporary political theories: An understanding of the underlying metaphysical, ontological, and anthropological assumptions that essentially inform these theories; of the relevance and specific meaning of concepts such as justice, freedom, or power; and, most importantly, of differing argumentative strategies of justifying the existence of the state philosophically. Thus, based on a careful reading of their politico-philosophical writings, it is to be considered how Plato and Aristotle, Hobbes and Rawls aim at finding a balance that resolves the inescapable tension between (stately) authority and (individual) autonomy. Additionally, the course aims at identifying the concepts of the political that, implicitly or explicitly, organize the political theories discussed.Previously taught:

Some specific topics we’ll discuss are: Hempel’s paradox of confirmation, Goodman’s “new riddle of induction”, Carnapian inductive logic, contemporary Bayesian confirmation theory and Bayesian epistemology, and various puzzles and paradoxes involving probability and evidence.Prerequisites. PHIL 12A, and willingness to engage both in mathematical and philosophical work.All readings for the course will be provided via the course website.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will focus largely on three interconnected areas:  what is it for a person to know the meaning of a language?  How is language related to the world?  How is language used in communication, and how does this use impact meaning?
    We’ll begin with the ‘classical’ accounts of Frege and Bertrand Russell, which influence much of the discussion that follows.  We’ll then consider Searle’s broadly Fregean account; it explains linguistic meaning in terms of the mental states (intentions, beliefs, desires) that underlie speech acts.  As do many Fregeans, Searle holds that “what’s in the head” is sufficient to determine a unique referent for proper names and general terms.  This view is vigorously attacked by Putnam, Kripke, and Burge, who argue that unique reference requires an external causal chain.  Searle’s reply turns on his analysis of demonstratives and indexicals (‘this’, ‘you’); we’ll compare this with standard accounts of demonstratives by Kaplan and Strawson.
    Quine approaches meaning from the point of view of ‘radical translation’ of a completely unknown language.  He argues that alternative translations are always possible (“indeterminacy of translation”), and therefore there is no matter of fact about meaning.  Davidson makes similar use of a 3rd person ‘interpreter’, but concludes that meaning is what is common to all possible interpretations.  Davidson’s theory of meaning makes central use of Tarski’s theory of truth, so we will read Tarski.  Davidson uses Tarski’s theory as a framework for a truth-conditional semantics for natural language.  We’ll also discuss the possible worlds approach to semantics (Lewis’ version).  McDowell charges that Davidson’s combination of holism and causal theory leaves us “spinning in the void” and unconnected to the world; we’ll take steps towards evaluating both McDowell’s argument and his positive account.
    Other topics will include:  Wittgenstein and Kripke on following a rule; refinements of the causal theory of reference by Dretske and Fodor; Grice’s theory of meaning; non-literal uses of language (implicature, metaphor, fiction, literary theory).  Many of our readings discuss holism and normativity.  Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.Previously taught:

It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy. Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills. This term we will be examining a number of philosophical texts on the problem of personal identity. There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading. In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper.Text: Personal Identity, edited by John Perry, University of California PressPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy.  We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as influential work by important contemporary philosophers (including Korsgaard, Nagel, Scanlon, and Williams).  Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)?  Why should we care about complying with moral demands?  What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)?  Is there anything interesting that we can say, in general terms, about what makes actions morally right or wrong?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will explore the question of whether music has meaning, and if so, what kind. Can music represent, say, birdsong, or the sea, or merely imitate? If music expresses emotions, then whose–those of the listener? the composer? the performer? We will consider parallels and contrasts between linguistic and musical meaning, theories of how music can be expressive, and the question of whether music can convey political meaning. The course will be taught as a seminar, and students will be expected to participate actively. Each week’s discussion will be structured around the interaction between musical excerpts and readings, drawn from historical and contemporary literature in philosophy, musicology, and the psychology of music. Requirements will include several short papers, a class presentation, and a final paper. Please note that this course is being taught as part of the “Big Ideas” breadth program; for details of the program, see http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will undertake a close study of Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding, with attention to philosophical and scientific context (Scholastic and Cartesian views of reality and our capacity for knowledge, Boyle’s corpuscularianism).  Among the topics to be considered: the nature of Lockean ideas, Locke’s distinction between primary and secondary qualities, his position on substance, the role of mechanism in his philosophy, his account of kinds and their essences, his view of the functioning of language, and his account of personal identity.  Throughout, we will keep in mind the Essay’s central aim of delimiting the extent of human knowledge.Reading: John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, ed. P. Nidditch (Oxford University Press, 1979), as well as selections in a course reader.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaBy any reasonable account, human beings have more knowledge today than ever before due to the progress of science, but there is still philosophical disagreement about what knowledge and justified belief are, how we should respond to radical skepticism, and how much science itself can tell us about knowledge. In this problem-oriented course we will study contemporary classics of epistemology on the topics of skepticism, justification, foundationalism, epistemic intuitions, tracking, closure, reliabilism, internalism, and externalism, among others.  We will take epistemology to be responsible for understanding scientific cases of knowledge, and also consider the implications for epistemology of results in experimental psychology suggesting human beings’ lack of awareness of the true reasons for their beliefs.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is a course about the epistemology of science. We will ask what makes something a scientific explanation, and what is required for observations to confirm (support) a hypothesis. We will ask how scientific models, experiments, and computer simulations are similar and different, and how scientists learn from each of these tools. We will pay particular attention to the example of climate models and simulations. Prerequisite: one course in philosophy.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments?  What is the nature of perception?  This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction into the main currents within Plato’s philosophy. This will include his conceptions of philosophy, the good life, the soul, causes and explanation, the hypothesis of the Forms, his account of human knowledge and some of the developments and revisions of these conceptions. Towards the second half of the semester the discussion will focus largely on Plato’s moral psychology. Important secondary literature will be made available on bspace. No previous knowledge of Plato required. Students are expected to actively participate and to occasionally give presentations. Required text: Plato. Complete Works. Ed. J. M.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will provide an intensive introduction to Descartes’s views on
physics, metaphysics and epistemology.  We will begin by examining some of
Descartes’s early works on method, physics and physiology.  We will then
turn to an in-depth study of the Meditations, focusing on both Descartes’s
epistemological project and his anti-scholastic metaphysics.  We will
supplement our study of the Meditations with readings from the Objections
and Replies, the Principles, and several important pieces of secondary
literature.  Some of the issues we will discuss in this section include
the method of doubt, the Cartesian circle, Descartes’s mode of
presentation in the Meditations, the creation and ontological status of
the eternal truths, the status of the human being, the nature of
substance, and the real distinction between mind and body.  After our
study of the Meditations, we will examine Descartes’s physics as presented
in the Principles.Previously taught:

His diagnosis of our “forgetfulness of being” will be explored in the context of his interpretations of Hölderlin and Nietzsche, both of whom grappled with the nihilism latent in modernity (“destitute times”/”The desert grows”). Particular attention will be paid to Heidegger’s focus on the role of works of art and poetry, “Things”, and “reflective thinking” as opening up possible ways out of this condition.Readings will include such central texts as “The Origin of the Work of Art”, “What are Poets for?” “The Question Concerning Technology”, “The Thing” and “On the Way to Language”.
Required texts: the essay collections Martin Heidegger. Poetry, Language, Thought (transl. Hofstadter). Martin Heidegger. The Question Concerning Technology and other Essays (transl. William Lovitt). Additional texts will be made available on bSpace.The course will be taught as a small seminar aimed at advanced students of philosophy, preferably with some background in Heidegger and/or Nietzsche.
Enrollment is limited, and by application only. Students should apply to the instructor directly (at kuk@berkeley.edu) at their earliest convenience; an initial selection will be made at the beginning of June.  Applications should include a brief statement outlining the applicant’s philosophical background and interest in the seminar. All applicants will be notified via email as to the result of their application; those admitted will receive course enrollment numbers with which they can enroll in the seminar through TeleBears.Previously taught:

(We will read the text in translation. There will also be a weekly Greek reading group for those interested.)Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will address a number of foundational issues concerning “possible worlds-based” approaches to language and thought: total worlds vs. partial situations; partial modal logic; aboutness; indexicals and indices; centered worlds; de se attitudes; and more.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe main topic for this seminar is the experience of time, and also the mental representation of time more generally. We’ll talk about subjective duration, including empirical models of psychological timing; extensionalism and retensionalism about temporal experience; the flow of time, and the continuity and unity over time of experience. The seminar will begin with an opinionated overview of some more general issues about experience and mental representation which will be relevant, including: quality spaces and phenomenal properties, internalist vs externalist views of experience, different views of computational explanation and mental representation.Note for those of you who attended my Unity and Temporal Experience seminar : I’ll try to minimize the overlap in content with this seminar, although inevitably there will be at least some.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe seminar will focus on the issues discussed in my forthcoming book,
Assessment Sensitivity: Relative Truth and Its Applications
(PDF).  The book
attempts to make solid philosophical sense of the fraught idea that
truth might be “relative,” an idea with a long philosophical history and
few adherents in the analytic tradition. It describes a novel way in
which thoughts and linguistic expressions can be contextually sensitive.
Familiar context-sensitive words like “here” and “I” are semantically
sensitive to features of the context of use. Thus, “here” denotes the
location at which the word is being used, “I” denotes the person using
it. Similarly, the truth of a tensed sentence like “Obama is president”
depends on the time of use.  Call this familiar kind of context
sensitivity use sensitivity. Assessment sensitivity, by contrast, is
semantic sensitivity to features of the context in which a use of the
expression is being assessed (in my lingo, a context of assessment).
Because a particular use of an expression can be assessed from
indefinitely many different contexts, it does not make sense to talk of
“the context of assessment” associated with a particular such use.
Rather, truth must be relativized to contexts of assessment. Thus,
making sense of semantic assessment sensitivity requires making sense of
(a certain kind of) “relative truth” – a notion often held to be
incoherent.Part of the work, then, is devoted to explaining how we can make room
for assessment sensitivity within existing formal semantic frameworks,
and to making an empirical case for the assessment sensitivity of
several kinds of discourse that have been puzzled philosophers and
linguists, including future contingents, predicates of personal taste,
knowledge ascriptions, epistemic modals, deontic claims, and indicative
conditionals. And part of the work is devoted to the more philosophical
task of fending off principled worries about the kind of “relative
truth” that the proposals countenance, and giving us a solid grip on
what it means to say that an expression is assessment-sensitive.The aim is to read and discuss the whole book, which will be the main
text for the seminar.  Supplementary readings will be suggested for each
chapter.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe’ll be looking back a quarter of a century at Joseph Raz’s The Morality of Freedom, and some of the central themes that classic text raises for us.The issues we are to address can be organized under three headings:(a) Authority & Consent(b) Neutrality & Paternalism© Consequentialism & Separatness of Person(a) Authority & Consent
One of the distinctive elements of Raz’s The Morality of Freedom is functional theory of authority it offers at the outset. It will be useful to contrast this with Anscombe’s earlier discussion of authority. We’ll finish off this topic looking back to earlier attempts to connect questions of authority and obligation to the existence of institutions.(b) Neutrality & Paternalism
Is it a requirement on a just politic order (or a just such order as conceived by liberalism) to be neutral among conceptions of the good? Raz launches a vituperative attack on what he sees as Rawls’s moral relativism lurking behind the demand for neutrality. We can compare this disagreement to some recent discussions of these issues: first Jonathan Quong’s complaint of paternalism against Raz; secondly van Wietmarschen and Leland’s attempt to understand it purely in terms of epistemic modesty.© Consequentialism & Separateness of Person
Despite the manner in which Raz insists his liberalism is different from Rawls, both join forces against traditional utilitarianism, and its modern consequentialist developments. We’ll look at Raz’s discussion of consequentialism and compare that to Williams’s original discussions of integrity. Again we’ll set this earlier discussion in the context of some more recent debate, in this case Larry Temkin’s discussion of separateness of person in his recent book.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaConsciousness is becoming more and more a central topic in analytic philosophy, and I want to pursue both some traditional and more recent issues.  Specifically the recent analysis in terms of information theory, by Tononi and Koch, I think is mistaken, and I want to say exactly how.  Nagel’s recent book Mind and Cosmos expresses doubts that we can explain consciousness with our existing conceptual resources.  I think he is mistaken and I want to say again how exactly how.  A third issue that I want to resume is the discussion of the Connection Principle relating consciousness to unconsciousness.  I think that these issues are at the very heart of cognitive science explanations.  A whole series of issues is raised by recent emphasis on the unconscious as more important than consciousness.  Such authors as Libet, Jeannerod, and Wegner should all be considered.  We cannot cover all of the issues in one semester, but I would like a general theory of consciousness to emerge. Anyone wishing to see a simple presentation of my general approach should see my recent TED talk at CERN in Geneva.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWith growing interest in the role of the body in perception, and in the related question of the possibility and nature of non-conceptual content, Merleau-Ponty’s classic work, Phenomenology of Perception, has become increasingly relevant.  We will read Phenomenology of Perception in order to understand and evaluate Merleau-Ponty’s arguments against what he calls empiricism (a sort of behaviorism) and intellectualism (cognitivism), as well as his positive account of what he calls motor intentionality  – a kind of intentionality without conceptual content that, Merleau-Ponty argues, is the basic way human beings are embedded in the world.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will investigate questions about the nature and limits of knowledge: Is knowledge compatible with the possibility of human error? Is the structure of our knowledge like a building that rests on a foundation or like a web held together by its connections? What are the requirements for knowledge? Can one know by accident? How can we acquire knowledge and avoid misinformation from others? Whom can we trust?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe aim of this course is to apply the concepts and methodology of contemporary philosophy to basic questions in the philosophy of religion, with an emphasis on the Western philosophical and religious traditions.  This includes questions concerning the nature and existence of God, the contrast between faith and reason, the nature of religious experience, the possibility of life after death, the incomprehensibility of God, and the relationship between God and morality.  The course readings will primarily be contemporary, though there will be some historical readings, and the course material will be arranged topically rather than chronologically.  This is a lower division course and so no prior experience in philosophy is required. Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe have two main aims in the seminar:  first, to get a clear picture of the main elements of Locke’s mechanistic philosophy of nature (including substance, identity, primary and secondary qualities, real and nominal essences, and the nature of explanation), and second, to evaluate the anti-essentialist arguments that Locke gives against the Aristotelian/Scholastic doctrine of substantial forms both in terms of their effectiveness against their intended target and in terms of their applicability to modern-day versions of essentialism (primarily Kripke’s and Putnam’s).  As regards the former, we will track similarities and differences between Locke’s views on these issues and those of his scientific mentor, Robert Boyle.  We will also briefly consider some background issues in Locke’s epistemology (for example, the rejection of innate ideas, the general theory of ideas and the question of indirect or representative realism), but the main focus will be on topics in metaphysics and the philosophy of science. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics. We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA course to encourage in philosophy majors the practice and development of the skills of reading and writing in philosophy. Readings will be drawn from recent essays on a variety of subjects in different areas of philosophy. These will be discussed in one two-hour classroom meeting each week. Students will be expected to read and discuss the essays in class and to write clearly and accurately about them and about the questions they raise. Each student will meet individually each week with a graduate student instructor for close assessment and discussion of the student’s writing with special attention to how it could be improved.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaNote: As taught this semester, Philosophy 108 will satisfy the Ethics requirement.As a thoughtful person, living in this country, at this time, you have at some point asked yourself some of the following questions. Should torture be allowed? Is there any difference between terrorism and “collateral damage”? May we kill enemy soldiers or even civilians to protect ourselves? Is capital punishment moral? Is abortion? Whether or not it’s moral, should it be legal? Should we let the majority or the courts decide? Is the government allowed to take your money and use it in ways you don’t want? If you have better grades and higher test scores, do you deserve a spot at UC more? Are you allowed to buy yourself an iPod when you could use the money to save people from starving? Should you buy a hybrid, rather than an SUV, when your individual choice is just “a drop in the bucket” and won’t really affect global warming?These questions can be difficult for many different reasons. Self- interest, prejudice, and fear can cloud our judgment. Religious authorities that we accept on faith, such as the Bible, can give unclear or conflicting directions. Finally, it can be hard to be sure of relevant facts: for example, whether information gained through torture tends to be reliable, whether the justice system applies the death penalty consistently, or whether burning fossil fuels leads to climate change.This course, however, is about another set of difficulties, which persist when we set aside our personal feelings, we see how far we can get without relying on faith, and we assume that we know the relevant facts. We may not be able to decide, by our own reflection and reasoning, which answers are correct, and even when we are sure that certain answers are correct, we may not be able to justify them. Our ethical ideas may seem not up to the task. Our aim in this course is to come to terms with these difficulties and to see to what extent they can be overcome.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaI. TOPICS: Absolute and relational theories of space, time, and motion: the problem of motion from Descartes, Newton and Leibniz to Einstein and beyond.  How the principle of relativity leads from space and time to space-time.  Mach’s attempt to ‘relativize’ inertia and its influence on Einstein in formulating the general theory of relativity.  Space-time substantivalism and relationism.  The problem of determinism in Einstein’s “Hole Argument”, and the physical meaning of general covariance. Background independence as a requirement for fundamental physical theory, including quantum gravity.II. PREREQUISITES: Some background in philosophy, physics or mathematics will be helpful. While no detailed knowledge of relativity physics or higher mathematics is presumed, discussion of the philosophical issues will occasionally necessitate introducing small doses of reasonably advanced mathematics (the mathematics of the general theory of relativity). However, most of the central concepts can be explained in pictures (as mappings) with a bit of set theory. Leave math anxiety at the door.III.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course reviews central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects. What explains our ability to refer to objects? Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it? And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon? We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Putnam, and theorists such as Dretske and Fodor who have built on their ideas. We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein. We will begin, however, with the classical views of Frege and Russell. Please note that lectures and discussions will assume that everyone present has completed one course in logic (in this the 135 course is different to the 135 course given in previous years).Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHow does human society differ from that of other social animals? How is it possible that there can be an objective reality of such things as money, property, government, marriage, and universities, even though such things exist only because we believe they exist? What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations. We will cover a large number of topics such as these: Why is the nation state such a powerful form of social organization? Why did socialism fail? Are there human rights, and if so what are they and where do they come from?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course deals with applications of game theory and rational choice theory to philosophical problems, as well as with paradoxes and problems introduced by these theories. After introducing the basic concepts of game theory, the first part of the course will be devoted to problems of cooperation and convention: how people manage to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit, e.g. drive on the same side of the road, carry out a project together, or use language. The next section will explore non-cooperative games, such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma; the possible application of these games to moral problems; and the need for and execution of a social contract. Finally, we turn to problems dealing with groups, such as the problem of collective action, and some issues in group decision making.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn investigation of the extent to which support can be found for the negative metaphysical doctrines that causation (or law-like dependence), absolute (or ‘logical’) necessity, and values are not part of a reality fully independent of us and our responses to the world.  The focus in each case will be on whether anyone who thinks and acts in the world in the ways we do could consistently understand our causal, modal, and evaluative attitudes as those metaphysical doctrines imply they are to be understood.  A further question will be the more general metaphysical significance of any such outcome.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will focus on early Chinese philosophical thought, including different schools such as Confucianism, Daoism, Moism and Yangism. We will discuss the connotations of key philosophical terms, analyze important passages, and consider the relation between and the influence among different early Chinese thinkers. While attending closely to texts, the emphasis is on philosophical ideas in the texts. The goal is to develop an understanding of the basic ideas of the different schools of thought as well as the relevant analytic skills. The course does not require knowledge of Chinese, and all readings will be in English translation. Required readings:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is a close examination of the structure of Spinoza’s philosophical system. Most of our time will be spent on a careful reading of Spinoza’s Ethics Demonstrated in Geometric Order, in which Spinoza argues for a comprehensive philosophical system that encompasses metaphysics, epistemology, psychology and ethics. Our primary goal will be to come to a deep understanding of Spinoza’s philosophical views, the relation of these views to those of his contemporaries, and the relevance of his views to contemporary philosophical theories.  Our reading of the Ethics will be informed by important pieces of correspondence between Spinoza and his contemporaries.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA course of close reading and detailed discussion of central parts of Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations. The aim is to understand Wittgenstein’s later work and its philosophical significance by responding as directly and as sympathetically as possible to the problems and lines of thought presented in that book. Some other works of Wittgenstein and some interpretative commentary will be consulted occasionally, but the focus throughout will be on that book. Because the book embodies a conception of philosophy as a certain kind of activity, the goal of the course is to encourage philosophical reflection and engagement by everyone through careful attention to the text, active participation in back-and-forth classroom discussion. The course is meant to be as much as possible an exercise in doing philosophy, not just commentary on a philosophical work.Previously taught:

We will address questions such as:  the essence of human experience, or the first-person point-of-view;  the relationships between human beings and their physical and social environments;  the role of the body in enabling or constituting experience;  what it means to be an “authentic” versus “inauthentic” self;  the appropriate attitude to take to human finitude and mortality;  the relations between first-personal and scientific approaches to human experience; and the philosophical methodology best suited to address all of the above questions.We will also read selections from other writers, such as Husserl, Sartre, and Beauvoir.  Depending on student interest, we will conclude the course either by looking back to the historical precursors of 20th-century phenomenology, such as Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, or by looking forward to the role of phenomenology in contemporary debates in philosophy of mind, action, and cognitive science.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe political philosophy of this and the past century has tended to focus on the question: What ends should the state pursue?  Formally, the answer is: the appropriate production and distribution of goods, construed broadly to include not simply material goods, but also security, liberty, opportunity.  More substantive answers come when we specify which goods and how they are to be distributed.  This tendency is manifest in the most celebrated work of 20th century political philosophy, John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice.  That theory is, essentially, that the “basic structure” of society is just just when it distributes liberties equally and socioeconomic goods according to the “difference principle.”  However, the roots of this tendency reach deeper into the utilitarian tradition, which answers the question, “What ends should the state pursue?” with “The greatest happiness for the greatest number.”A different and earlier tradition, however, largely devoted itself to a different question.  Whatever ends the state pursues, it pursues them by issuing commands to others that are in some sense “binding”: authoritative, or obligating, or enforceable, or coercive, or some such.  Who, if anyone, has the “right” (the permission, or the normative power, or the exclusive claim) to issue such commands to whom?  Who, if anyone, has the right to rule over whom?  This is the central preoccupation of the debate between Sir Robert Filmer and John Locke, for example.Now, perhaps this tradition is misguided.  Perhaps, so long as the state is achieving the appropriate ends—which, recall, already includes an appropriate distribution of wealth, liberty, opportunity, and so forth among rulers and ruled—who rules whom, or whether anyone rules anyone, is a matter of indifference.  Our question is whether this is the whole story.  Supposing that otherwise the right ends are being achieved, is there any valid concern about the very fact that some rule over others?  What, if anything, might the concern be, and what, if anything, might answer it?We will approach these questions by asking two more familiar questions (albeit in reverse order): What, if anything, justifies the state?  And what, if anything, justifies democracy, in particular?The spine of the course, for better or worse, will be the instructor’s work in progress.  But we will also read work of greater and more lasting value, by John Rawls, Joseph Raz, Ronald Dworkin, T.M. Scanlon, and Philip Pettit, among others.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaScience, from its beginning, has taken inspiration from what Bernard Williams called the Absolute Conception of Reality. This is a conception of the world as “it really is” entirely apart from how it appears to us: a colorless, odorless, meaningless and value-free domain organized in accordance with timeless and immutable mathematical laws. Modern science shapes a conception of the cosmos, its subject matter, that excludes us. And so it shouldn’t be a surprise that it has proved difficult, over the centuries, to find a place for us, and for phenomena such as meaning, experience, value, purpose, not to mention religion and art, in the natural order so conceived. Maybe it’s just a matter of time. Newer sciences such as neuroscience and linguistics are moving in, step by step, on the sought after comprehension of ourselves. Or maybe the problem runs deeper than that and stems from our very conception of nature itself and so also of what a natural science is supposed to be and so what the right sort of explanations are supposed to look like?In this seminar we ask after the nature of nature. It is our aim to raise questions and to indicate possible ways forward.Among the authors whose work we will read are Thomas Nagel, Bernard Williams, Hilary Putnam, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Evan Thompson.This is a research seminar designed primarily for graduate students of philosophy.

Their contribution to what is expressed by sentences containing them depends systematically on features of the context in which they are used.  In the wake of David Kaplan’s seminal work on the logic and semantics of indexicals in the 1970s, it has become popular to represent this context sensitivity formally by relativizing sentence truth to a “context of use.”Kaplan’s work was focused fairly narrowly on standard indexicals and demonstratives.  Recently, however, philosophers and semanticists have been busily extending the bounds of semantic context sensitivity to other kinds of expressions, including gradable adjectives like ‘tall’ and ‘flat’, counterfactual and indicative conditionals, epistemic modals like ‘might’ and ‘possibly’, propositional attitude verbs, and terms of epistemic assessment like ‘know’ and ‘justify’.  Accompanying the first-order discussion of these expressions (which is often motivated by philosophical as well as semantic concerns) has been considerable methodological discussion about just where to draw the line between semantic and pragmatic sources of context sensitivity.  In addition to various moderate positions that draw the line in different places, two extreme positions have been defended: conservatives have argued that semantic context sensitivity is limited to the canonical indexicals, while radicals have argued that it infects all language to such an extent that formal semantics is impossible.  In the first part of the seminar, we will try to sort out what is at stake in these debates.In the second part of the seminar, I will argue for a generalization of Kaplan’s framework, in which truth is relativized not just to a context of use but also to what I call a “context of assessment.”  I will argue that this generalization is needed in order to make good semantic and philosophical sense of epistemic modals, terms of epistemic assessment (like ‘know’), predicates of personal taste (like ‘fun’),  tense (in an indeterministic framework), indicative conditionals, and possibly other bits of language.  These expressions, I will argue, are context-sensitive, but not in the familiar way.  Instead of being “use-sensitive,” they are “assessment-sensitive.”  In addition to working out a formal framework for the description of assessment sensitivity, we will grapple head-on with the philosophical difficulties raised by assessment sensitivity and the kind of “relative truth” it requires.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn open-ended discussion-seminar exploring some necessary conditions of thought and some epistemological and metaphysical consequences of those conditions’ being fulfilled.

We will begin by examining some of the late scholastic discussions concerning modes and qualities more generally. In the rest of the semester, we will be looking closely at a number of early modern figures, including Galileo, Descartes, Boyle, Locke, and Clarke.  On what basis do these scientists and philosophers draw the distinction between primary and secondary qualities, and where do they draw the line between them?  To what extent is the distinction based on a priori metaphysical or epistemological considerations; to what extent is it based on what an empirical physical theory says the world is like?  What is the relation of the distinction to corpuscularianism and to mechanistic explanation?  Secondary qualities are sometimes characterized as being reducible to primary qualities; sometimes, as powers to bring about ideas of certain sorts; sometimes, as merely subjective and as lacking any reality.   What is the relation between these different characterizations of secondary qualities? Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will mix issues in metaphysics with issues in the foundations of semantics (the semantics of both artificial languages and natural language). It is about some problems concerning the relationship between reality and our ways of representing or modeling it.Some of the questions we’ll ask: What is it to model reality? How do we separate semantic facts about the way that a model is to be interpreted from the substantive theses we use the model to articulate? Are there metaphysical questions that cannot be framed except in a partially question-begging way, and if so, what is the right methodology in such cases?  How do we distinguish the artifactual features of a model from the genuinely explanatory features? In what way are the symmetry properties of a model a guide to what it is “really representing”? What is the nature of the relation between natural language and the artificial technical languages we devise in order to limb the structure of reality? What is the appropriate response to cases where natural language seems to be presupposing a "false metaphysics”? Does it even make sense to talk about natural language semantics as somehow coming with substantive metaphysical presuppositions? What is the right understanding of the models used in natural language semantics to “interpret” natural language?Readings will come from Stalnaker, Kripke, Chomsky, Humberstone, Dasgupta, Lee & Yalcin.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhen we think about how we ought to live it is perfectly natural to ask what features of the world make claims on us and give us reasons to do certain things rather than other things. Some of these features of the world seem to have a special importance, and to give rise to special reasons: that there is gratuitous suffering; that there are people we can help at very little cost to ourselves; that some are worse off than others through no fault of their own. These observations seem to give rise to special moral reasons for acting.  But what is the nature of these reasons, and what sorts of facts about the world give rise to them? Is it even correct to think that there are such facts and reasons? If there are, how can this be? In virtue of what are right actions right, wrong actions wrong? This course is an introduction to philosophical investigation of these questions. No previous experience in philosophy is required or will be assumed. The course will begin by examining a historically central question in the domain – Why be moral? – and then proceed to ask questions about the nature of moral discourse:  Are there objective ethical truths, or are all ethical claims personally or socially relative? Are ethical claims true or false like ordinary claims about the way the world is? What is the nature of moral disagreement? Then we will move on to to discuss particular theories about the content of morality. What make right actions right? What is the relationship between what is right and what is valuable? Is there one supreme duty? Lastly, we will extend this investigation into the political domain, focusing on the value of equality. What is the nature of equality? Is there some understanding of it according to which it is valuable that people be made equal, even if it imposes costs on others? Or can our aversion to great inequality be accounted for by other values? Other issues in the applied and political domains will be addressed, time permitting.   Previously taught:

It is divided into three parts. In the first part, we will ask: what is it to have a mind? What kinds of properties are so-called mental properties? Can they be satisfactorily explained in terms of physical, behavioral, or functional properties of organisms? If so, how? If not, why not?In the second part of the course, we will examine the nature of our knowledge of mental states. What is the connection between knowledge of one’s own mental states and knowledge of the mental states of others? What is the connection between knowledge of one’s own mental states and knowledge of the world around us?The third part of the course concerns psychological explanation. What are we doing when we explain people’s behavior in terms of their beliefs, desires, and other contentful states? How is such explanation different from ordinary explanations of the behavior of other animals? How is it different from explanations of the behavior of inanimate objects?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat is it for an argument to be deductively valid? Intuitively, the conclusion must “follow from” the premises, or the truth of the premises must “guarantee” the truth of the conclusion.  In this course we will look at how this notion is made formally precise in three systems of logic: sentential logic, monadic predicate logic, and full first-order logic.  We will learn how to represent the logical forms of English arguments in each of these systems, and then develop a semantics as well as a system of natural deduction in each system to assess the validity of arguments given such formal representations.  Upon completing the course, students can expect to be familiar with the basic concepts of symbolic logic, and to be in a better position to formulate and evaluate arguments in natural languages like English.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy, focusing primarily on Plato and Aristotle.  The ancient Greeks formulated many of the problems that continue to occupy philosophers, and so the course also provides an introduction to philosophical thinking in general.  But the study of ancient philosophers is exciting not only because we share many of their philosophical concerns: We will be attempting to understand a way of thinking that is, in some respects, deeply alien to our own.  By doing so, we can come to see our own philosophical assumptions and prejudices in a new light.As taught this session, the course will center on ethics (How should I live? What is the good life?) and political philosophy (How should we live together? What political arrangements are best?).  However, the systematic character of Greek philosophy — the way in which these philosophers base their ethical views on an understanding of the natural world and our place within it — means that we will also consider questions concerning the nature of reality and human knowledge.We will spend the bulk of our time examining the views of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle — and, especially, their reasons for holding those views.   We may occasionally look at certain ancient Greek poets, historians and Sophists, in the hopes of gaining a better understanding of the problems that these philosophers were addressing.  If time permits, we will also consider later Hellenistic philosophy (including the Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics).  This course presupposes no prior work in philosophy.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled.
By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will be mostly concerned with recent work on philosophical problems connected with consciousness, but I would also like to tie the research on consciousness to some questions about the freedom of the will.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will explore topics in the philosophy of art. What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century).Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.Previously taught:

The central question we ask: Can we give make sense of mind as a natural phenomenon? We will read widely in philosophy and cognitive science as we seek to answer this fundamental question. Among the topics we will cover: the nature of perception and consciousness, the possibility of machine minds, neuroscience as the basic science of human experience, our knowledge of each other.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will examine some of the main themes in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. This rather demanding text gives a systematic account of the nature of our cognitive capacities with a special focus on the resulting limitations for human knowledge. We will examine Kant’s project by looking at his account of the possibility of experience, his conception of a priori knowledge, space and time, appearances vs. things in themselves, and more.
Students are required to give a short in–class presentation, and to write three short papers and a longer term paper. Philosophy 25B is highly desirable.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to practical philosophy, by means of selected topics in moral and political philosophy. We begin by considering two kinds of moral theory that have dominated the contemporary scene. We will then use these theoretical frameworks to investigate the morality of abortion, and the right to privacy. In the second half of the course we consider the relationship between citizen and state. In particular, we ask whether political authority is ever justified, and consider the special case of democratic authority. The justification of action by political authorities is thought to be especially problematic in societies where there is deep disagreement, and so we end by asking about the possibility and value of toleration in diverse societies like our own.Previously taught:

in the philosophy of mind, as well as to philosophical thinking in
general.  We will be addressing such questions as: What is a mind, and what is
it to have particular mental states, such as beliefs or conscious
experiences?  How do we know about our minds and the minds of others?
What is the self, what it is to be the same person over time, and what
importance does this question have?  These questions will lead us to
the question of how our minds relate to our bodies, and how scientific

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to the philosophical thought of ancient
Greece.  We will approach a broad range of philosophical questions by
examining and writing about the philosophy of Socrates, Plato,
Aristotle, and other ancient authors.  Among the questions we will ask
are: What does reality consist in, and how do we know about it?  What
is the nature of knowledge?  What is the structure of the soul?  What
is virtue, and how does one acquire it?  And what is required to lead
a good life?  We study these foundational questions of metaphysics,
epistemology and ethics through the eyes of ancient philosophers
because they were the first to ask these questions, and the first to
devise methods for answering them which are continuous with our
philosophical practice today.  For this reason, the course serves as a
good introduction to philosophical thought and method generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will survey the ideas of five important philosophers of
the 17th and 18th century – Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and
Kant. We will consider how they pose and develop responses to
important metaphysical and epistemological questions that form the
basis of some of the main concerns of modern philosophy. These include
questions about the nature of reality (Does God exist? What is the
nature of the human mind? How does the mind relate to the body? Are
there causal connections in the world?), as well as the relation
between us and the world (What do we perceive? Can we come to know
things about the world through perception? Are there things we can
know to be true through reason alone? Are there limits on what we can
know?) We will attempt to develop a historical understanding of the
connections across the views we consider, as well as to
philosophically engage with and respond to each in its own right.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis introductory class will examine the works of four classical protagonists of Western political thought: Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. In focusing on early modern political philosophy and, in particular, on contractarian thought, it is meant to provide students with a basic understanding of paradigmatic politico-philosophical approaches: An understanding of the underlying metaphysical and ontological, historical and anthropological assumptions that essentially inform these approaches; of the relevance and specific meaning of concepts such as freedom, justice, citizenship, or power; and, most importantly, of differing argumentative strategies of justifying the existence as well as the authority of the state philosophically. Thus, based on a careful reading of their writings, it is to be considered how Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, and Kant attempt to find a balance that resolves the inescapable tension between (individual) autonomy and (stately) authority. Additionally, the course aims at identifying the concepts of the political that, implicitly or explicitly, organize the theories discussed.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis class is an introduction to a range of historical and contemporary feminist issues.  Is there an essential difference between women and men?  If so, what is the nature of this difference and what are its moral, social, and political implications?  If not, what explains the apparent differences?  How do questions about gender intersect with questions about race, class, religion, and cross-cultural difference?  Can a psychological account of how we tend to sort people into distinct social categories illuminate how we ought to understand these categories?  Can assumptions about gender compromise scientific objectivity?  This course introduces philosophy students to these and related questions in feminist thought, concluding with analyses of a few specific debates in contemporary feminist epistemology, ethics, and metaphysics.Previously taught:

Mitsein is crucial to Heidegger’s conception of Dasein in its essential tension between the poles of authenticity and inauthenticity, as well as for Heidegger’s later thinking on art, technology and language (as the ‘house of being’). But it has also been at the heart of controversies amongst both foes and followers of Heidegger’s philosophy. Thinkers as diverse and significant as Hannah Arendt, Emmanuel Levinas, Herbert Marcuse, Hans Jonas, Jürgen Habermas, and  Charles Taylor have all been profoundly influenced (positively or critically) by Heidegger’s ontological approach to grounding ethics. For some it epitomizes Heidegger’s failed attempt to capture the deeply social aspect of intersubjectivity, a failure that led to his dangerously inadequate grasp of the political dimension of human existence. To others it became a stepping stone to developing their own notions of  ‘love of the world’ or ‘amor mundi’ (Arendt), ‘alterity ‘(Levinas), and ‘responsibility’ (Jonas). We will study the relevant sections of Being and Time (in particular §§25-27 and 74) and trace Heidegger’s development of these ideas in his thinking (looking at  excerpts from Basic Concepts of Metaphysics and other lectures, as well as such influential later essays as The Thing and The Question Concerning Technology).  After that we will focus on important critical objections as well as interesting new perspectives on intersubjectivity and community by the above named philosophers and other, more contemporary thinkers.Requirements:

(2) When, where, and how can it be morally permissible? The first question is broadly speaking metaphysical: it is about the nature of certain sorts of things in our social world. This part of the seminar will to some extent engage the classic, much larger question of what art is, but via the special case of street art. The second question is an ethical question. Street art characteristically appears without permission on private property, or in public spaces that are centrally controlled. It often involves violations of law. When exactly is it wrong? A special case we will discuss is this: some street artists are especially known for removing advertising and replacing it with their artwork. Is this kind of thing wrong, or always wrong? Or can it be a legitimate form of protest? With whom exactly does legitimate control of the public visual space lie? Students of philosophy, art, art history, urban planning, and areas allied to these would be natural candidates for this course. But I will not be presupposing any specific background knowledge. So the course should make sense for any interested student prepared to think critically about these issues. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.Previously taught:

In what ways are they still of relevance to life in the twenty-first century? The course will consider the contemporary implications of Confucius’ teachings for such topics as: family, rituals, life and death, fate, contentment and anxiety, anger and resentment, courage, respectfulness, modesty and humility, trustworthiness, learning, self-cultivation, semblances of virtue. In addition to reading selected passages from the Analects, we will also consider commentaries by later Confucians and read contemporary philosophical articles on the relevant topics.Required Readings

We will focus, in particular, on the connexions between the morality of individual agents and issues of social justice. At the individual level, we will be consider both how one ought to live one’s life, and what kind of person one ought to be. At the social level, we will consider the nature and requirements of social justice, as well as which means society’s may be obligated or permitted to use in achieving it. Throughout the course, we will examine and reexamine the connexions between the individual and social levels. To what extent, if any, do the requirements of social justice impose moral obligations on individuals? For example, if one lives in an unjust society, is one obligated to protest the injustice? What difference does it make if an individual must risk severe penalties in order to protest effectively? On the other hand, if some individuals do not behave morally, does social justice require the community to encourage or, even, enforce better behaviour? It is clear that individual morality and social justice are not independent. In what ways, and to what extent, do they depend on each other? Is it possible for to live one’s life well, and to be a good moral agent, if one lives in an unjust society? To what extent must a just society depend on the morality of its individual members?Previously taught:

The bulk of the course will be spent on the analysis of the philosophical motives, methods and views of Socrates (469 – 399 BC), Plato (427-347 BC), and Aristotle (384-322 BC). Since the ancient Greeks identified many of the philosophical problems (and models for their resolution) we are still concerned with today, the course may also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe readings and discussion for Phil 100 in Fall 2014 will center around different philosophical views and ideas about “the self”, and the closely related notion of “person”. Is there a “self” at the center of everyone’s conscious life, and if so what is it? What distinguishes one person from another person? What is it for a person to keep existing from one moment to the next? What is death? And why is death bad? What is the moral significance of distinctions between individual people and their lives? What makes a life valuable? Finally, how is the distinction between one person and another of importance in deciding what makes for a just political system?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course offers a survey of some of the main systematic approaches to issues in moral philosophy.  We will look at several exemplary texts from the modern history of the subject (by Hobbes, Hume, Sidgwick, and Kant), as well as influential work by important contemporary philosophers (including Foot, Korsgaard, Scanlon, and Williams).  Issues to be discussed include the following: What is it that distinguishes morality from other sets of requirements (e.g. those of etiquette or law or self-interest)?  Why should we care about complying with moral demands?  What is the relation between the right and the good (both the good of the agent, and the impersonal good)?  Is there anything interesting that we can say, in general terms, about what makes actions morally right or wrong?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn upper-division course in the philosophical theory of knowledge.  Not a general survey of the field, but an investigation of three fundamental epistemological questions about perceptual knowledge.-How does what we have perceived give us knowledge of or reasonable belief in something we are not perceiving to be so at the moment?-How does what we perceive at a particular time give us knowledge of or reasonable belief in something that is so at that very time?-How does what each of us perceives give us knowledge of or reasonable belief in the thoughts, feelings, or attitudes of other people?There are apparently indisputable ways of thinking of human knowledge and perception in philosophy that raise serious challenges to satisfyingly positive answers to these questions.  The course will concentrate on the distinctively philosophical character of the epistemological problems and on how, if at all, perception, thought, belief, and knowledge must be understood to overcome the apparent obstacles to our self-understanding.Two lecture-discussion classes and one mandatory discussion section each week.  Students will be expected to write three five-page papers during the semester (one on each of the three topics) as well writing assigned in connection with discussion sections.  Lectures and discussions will presuppose close reading of the material contained in a Philosophy 122 reader (available at the beginning of the semester) as well as supplementary reading suggested at different points during the semester.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments? What is the nature of perception? This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe philosophy of perception is a microcosm of the metaphysics of mind. Its central problems – What is perception? What is the nature of perceptual consciousness? How can one fit an account of perceptual experience into a broader account of the nature of the mind and the world? – are problems at the heart of metaphysics. It is often justifiably said that the theory of perception (and especially vision) is the area of psychology and neuroscience that has made the greatest progress in recent years. Despite this progress, or perhaps because of it, philosophical problems about perception retain a great urgency, both for philosophy and for science.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course covers some of the most important metalogical results that are of interest to philosophers. It is divided into three parts. The first two parts are mathematical in style whereas the last part is philosophical. In the first part we will cover the basic notions of computability theory and study in detail the Turing machine approach to computability. The second part of the course will give a detailed presentation of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and related results. Finally, we will look at the philosophical relevance of these logical results to various areas of philosophy.Prerequisite: 12A (or equivalent) or permission from the instructor.Course requirements: exercise sets approximately every ten days (counting for 60% of final grade) and a philosophical paper due at the end of the semester (40% of final grade).Previously taught:

Special attention will be paid to the ways in which the philosophers in this period assimilate Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy into religious thought and how they anticipate certain aspects of modern philosophy. Topics will include the nature of universals, individuation, the nature and existence of God, faith and reason, skepticism, freedom, human nature and human cognition.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course provides an introduction to topics in the philosophy of science, with readings from primary sources. We start with an introduction to the philosophy of space and time, through the correspondence of Leibniz and Clarke. Next we examine the influential Logical Positivism movement and its progeny: confirmationism and falsificationism. We then spend some time analyzing Kuhn’s notion of scientific revolutions, and consider a case study in the history of science: the Copernican revolution. We come full circle and revisit the philosophy of space and time from the standpoint of 20th century physics, including empirical and theoretical results, and consider our new world view in the light of Einsteinian relativity.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will provide an intensive introduction to Descartes’s views on physics, metaphysics and epistemology. We will begin by examining some of Descartes’s early works on method, physics and physiology. We will then turn to an in-depth study of the Meditations, focusing on both Descartes’s epistemological project and his anti-scholastic metaphysics. We will supplement our study of the Meditations with readings from the Objections and Replies, the Principles, and several important pieces of secondary literature. Some of the issues we will discuss in this section include the method of doubt, the Cartesian circle, Descartes’s mode of presentation in the Meditations, the creation and ontological status of the eternal truths, the status of the human being, the nature of substance, and the real distinction between mind and body. After our study of the Meditations, we will examine Descartes’s physics as presented in the Principles.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSchopenhauer’s pessimism and Nietzsche’s forceful ‘affirmation of life’ seem to be worlds apart from each other.  On closer analysis, though, many of Nietzsche’s central theses can be understood properly only against the background of Schopenhauer’s thought.The course offers a systematic comparison of both philosophers’ interpretations of life and human existence. Particular attention will be paid to the role of art and the function of aesthetic experience in their accounts of life. Other topics to be discussed include the nature of the will and human drives; the relation between the intellectual ego and the bodily self; language and truth; and the diagnosis and evaluation of nihilism.Readings will include selections from Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation and central texts by Nietzsche from the different phases of his philosophy, including key selections from The Birth of the Tragedy, The Gay Science, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, The Genealogy of Morals and his posthumously published late notes (Will to Power).Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is devoted to some central questions in political philosophy and ethics: authority, neutrality, rights, equality, pluralism, consequentialism and well-being. It is focused particularly on a close reading of Joseph Raz’s The Morality of Freedom.
This is a proseminar – a novel format of class, different from most classes in our department. Instead of a standard lecture format, classes will be focused on the texts that form the basis of the course. The aim is that we should all together get to grips with these texts, making sense of what they claim and how they argue for it, by discussing collaboratively readings as we proceed. Participation is expected in every class. Classes in this format demand preparation in advance: it is essential that you do the set reading and think hard about it before each class.
This is an upper-level philosophy course. Students should be philosophy majors and must have taken at least two prior upper-division philosophy courses.
NOTE: as taught this semester, Phil190 satisfies the ethics requirement for the philosophy major.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will examine different approaches, both historical and contemporary, to the question of what faith is.  Several guiding questions will be important as we examine each approach.  Is religious faith the same attitude as mundane faith?  What is the relationship between faith and belief, between faith and knowledge, and between faith and doubt?  Does having faith require going against the evidence?  When is faith rationally required or rationally impermissible?  When is faith morally required or morally impermissible?  To what extent is faith an attitude that is essential to ordinary human lives, and why? Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe know more than ever about the processes in the brain that give rise to conscious experience. This might lead us to hope that one day we might possess a complete “theory of consciousness”. But do we really know what form such a theory would take, or whether it is possible in principle that we could come to know it? In this seminar, we will look at some of the foundational problems that arise when we try to imagine such a theory.This will include (time permitting): (1) The problem of psycho-physical correlation: can the crude correlational information we currently possess in principle be refined into completely precise psycho-physical laws? (2) Phenomenal properties and quality spaces : many philosophers believe that experiences have “phenomenal” or “qualitative” properties that make experience hard to explain. What kind of claim is this, and could it be wrong? What exactly is it that makes the presence of such properties hard to understand?  We will look at the notion of a “quality space” and assess it’s potential for helping us understand the nature of these special properties. (3) The explanatory gap, and other special explanatory problems.  Although the well-known “explanatory gap” problem for consciousness won’t be the main focus of the seminar, we will spend at least some time discussing it.  (4) The problem of extrapolation : how, if at all, can we extend our understanding of conscious experience beyond the case of humans to other creatures and physical systems? To what extent are questions about the experience of other creatures substantive questions?Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaHome | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaRecent Contractualism: Foundations and Applications. This seminar is on contractualist approaches to moral and political philosophy. We will look at the contractualist tradition in history; Rousseau in particular. And we will address contemporary contractualist theories, in particular John Rawls and TM Scanlon.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn introduction to some central issues in moral and political philosophy. The course will be  structured around a discussion of objectivity, disagreement, and pluralism in the domain of value. We will begin by addressing arguments for and against the objectivity of moral  judgments, and consider their implications for the interpretation of moral discourse and moral  practice. Next we will take up a range of concrete moral issues (involving war, killing, sex, and  our obligations to those in need), and consider the distinctive normative issues they raise. We  will then look at the requirements of living a meaningful human life, and explore their relations  to morality. In the final sections of the course we will turn to issues of social and political theory, looking at the nature of a just society and at the problems of pluralism and toleration.  Texts will be taken from contemporary sources, and will be collected in a course reader.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaLogic is about reasoning, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and how to tell the difference between good and bad reasoning.In this course, we will develop techniques for laying bare the structure of arguments (“reasonings”). This will enable us then to characterize, in some precise ways, the difference between good and bad reasoning, and to formulate rules of correct reasoning. These three things – a conception of structure of arguments, a precise characterization of good and bad arguments in terms of their structure, and a system of rules of correct reasoning – constitute a “system of logic.” We will actually consider several systems of logic. After all this, students should be in a better position to properly formulate and evaluate logical arguments.The course will focus on deductively correct reasoning. That is, we will consider “good reasoning” to be reasoning in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion (as in typical correct mathematical reasoning). This will briefly be put into perspective in relation to inductively good reasoning, in which the premises give significant, but not conclusive, support for a conclusion.Textbook: Modern Logic by Graeme Forbes, Oxford University Press, 1994.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe main theses I will be exploring in this class are:A running question will be:  ‘What is the relation between our ordinary understanding of the mind, and a scientific understanding of humans?’.There are two types of philosophical objection to this picture, which suggest that psychological explanation and understanding are not merely a matter of causality:The mind is fundamentally a rational structure, and rational connections are a priori, rather than having to be discovered empirically, as causal connections are.Psychological understanding is fundamentally a matter of imaginative or empathetic understanding, and this kind of imaginative understanding is to be contrasted with causal explanation.On these views, psychological explanation and understanding are not merely forms of causal explanation and understanding.We will in general be looking at how phenomena of central interest in philosophy of mind, such as perception or consciousness, are to be described in terms of causation, and looking at current analyses of what causation as such is, in particular, analyses in terms of potential interventions, and analyses in terms of the idea of a causal process.Background reading:Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhen Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov first appeared, in 1879, its first readers experience the novel as a call to personal, social, and political renewal. One reader wrote: “After the Karamazovs (and while reading it), I looked around in horror that everything went on as before, that the world did not shift on its axis…” Dostoevsky himself thought that the main question of the novel was the need for God and immortality, but many read the novel in a secular mode, asking: What is evil? Why do the innocent suffer? Where are the limits of each person’s moral responsibility for the problems of the world? Is love before logic? The novel deals with some of our deepest anxieties:  the feeling of aggression against one’s own family, rebellion against established authority, and experience of sexual desire. Today, it speaks to our experience of isolation and appeals to forces that draw human beings joyfully together. The novel does not provide answers through logical argumentation: it is a complex literary form. This team-taught seminar (cross listed in the departments of Philosophy and Slavic Languages and Literatures) will discuss the novel from the double perspective of literature and philosophy.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe all are acquainted with people who think they know far more about important things than they really do.  But what if we are such people?  How do we know whether our beliefs are really knowledge, or just an accumulation of superstition and half-truths inherited from parents, culture, peer-groups and the like?  Philosophers have taken such self-questioning to extremes.  Do I know that there is an external world?  That I really exist?  That the world wasn’t created five years, or five minutes, ago, with lots of misleading evidence about being older?  We will look at the structure of knowledge, doubts philosophers have had about it, and helpful positive accounts of its nature that have emerged.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course addresses basic questions in the philosophy of religion, primarily from the Western philosophical tradition. For example, does God exist? Should we believe in God? What is the relationship between religious belief and scientific knowledge? How should a just God punish us for our moral wrongdoing? What is forgiveness, and what does it mean to say that God forgives? Finally, is morality based on God’s commands? The course material will be arranged topically, rather than historically, and will be divided into four sections: arguments for and against the existence of God, epistemology, metaphysics, and morality.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicates the intuitive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’) and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’). In addition, we will also develop techniques for showing when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus. Textbook: J. Barwise, J.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn examination of some philosophical problems about the intentionality
of language and thought. By virtue of what are some things in the world
(for example, sentences and thoughts) about others? Is meaning always
a matter of interpretation, or do some things have meaning independently
of interpretation? Is conceptual thought prior to language? What would
it take for a computer to have thoughts? Are the meanings of our words
and the contents of our mental states determined by what’s going on
inside our brains, or do they depend also on features of our physical
and social environments? Could there be facts about meaning we could
only discover by looking in someone’s brain? Are there objective facts

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn the early seventeenth century, René Descartes proposed a radical new approach to enquiry: the Method of Doubt. This seminar will focus on Descartes’ Method: who is supposed to use it? How is the method meant to work? What did Descartes think it could achieve? Does it succeed? We will begin by reading, and critically evaluating, Descartes’ Meditations on First Philosophy and Discourse on Method. In the second part of the seminar, we will explore contemporary critiques of Descartes’ Method and its continuing influence on Western philosophy.The structure of the seminar will encourage students to develop their abilities to read critically, analyze and evaluate arguments, and engage in constructive philosophical debate. Students should be willing to read and reread the text with care, raise questions, and think independently.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will be a close examination of one of the most important and influential books of the early modern period: John Locke’s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.  The Essay was a central source of (modern) empiricism in the 17th and 18th centuries, and paved the way for later empiricist philosophers such as Berkeley and Hume.  In it Locke discusses the “origin, certainty and extent of human knowledge,” which he uses to address problems in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of religion.  In this course we will study the arguments of the Essay while also keeping in mind the scientific and philosophical contexts in which the work was written.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSince its publication in 1927 Heidegger’s major work Being and Time has been many things to its various recipients. Though the work has made major contributions to existential thought, hermeneutics, and post-structuralism its main concern is a revolution of what Heidegger regarded as the central term of philosophy since antiquity: the concept of being. Because he viewed the traditional understanding of this concept as superficial and misguided, his plan was (in part) to work out a new fundamental ontology. Its design was (I) to reveal the true meaning of being on the basis of temporality as its transcendental horizon and (II) to point out the crucial missteps in the tradition (Aristotle, Descartes and Kant) that led to the misconception. Heidegger never finished his ambitious project, but the work’s first part with its extensive analysis of human understanding as the basis of the conception of being was sufficient to make this work a major challenge to friend and foe alike. The course will be confined to a close study of the difficult text itself, focusing on the connection between the question of being, the analysis of human nature, and the phenomenological method that Heidegger presents as the necessary foundations of his project in Division I. We will also cover his analysis of death, conscience, resoluteness, and Dasein’s authentic potentiality for being ‘whole’, i.e. the first three chapters of Division II.Text to be used: Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, translated by John Macquarrie/Edward Robinson, paperback reprint 2008, Harper Perennial Modern Thought Series.

Other works by Wittgenstein and some interpretative commentary will be consulted occasionally, but the emphasis throughout will be on reading and understanding this book.  The book embodies a conception of philosophy as a certain kind of intellectual activity, so the course is likely to be of interest and value only to those willing to respond in open discussion to the problems and lines of thought presented there; those responses are themselves part of the “data” for philosophy.  This requires active engagement in discussion in class and in weekly discussion-sections and in any other setting that presents itself.  This is meant to be as much as possible a course in doing philosophy, not simply in studying or commenting on somebody else’s philosophy.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn his dialogue Timaeus Plato presents his philosophy of nature. Roughly speaking, the dialogue tells a ‘likely’ or ‘reasonable’ story about how intelligible structure comes to be present in the physical world. The story consists of a teleological creation myth in which we are told how the Demiurge, Plato’s divine master-builder, endows the world with order, structure and regularity because it is good. The result is the Cosmos, a divine living being distinctively marked by harmony and proportion. However, Plato’s craftsman does not create the universe out of nothing. Like every other craftsman he has to work with given materials. But the resistant nature of the still unformed and chaotic material imposes significant constraints on the process of the creation of the physical world. Thus, the Demiurge arranges everything in the best way as far as this is possible, which means, as far as the character of the found materials permits. The Timaeus provides a fairly complete picture of the Cosmos from the creation of the heavenly bodies down to the affairs of humankind. For Plato, the description of the Cosmos is not a purely theoretical project. The dialogue does not distinguish between science and value statements and it appears that this is intentionally so: for Plato, the story of the origin of the universe seems to be directly related to the question of the right human life.We will use the English translation of Donald Zeyl, in J. M. Cooper (ed.), Plato: Complete Works  (Hackett, 1997). There will be an optional Greek reading group for those interested.Reading for the first session: (1) Timaeus 17a1-27d4; (2) T. K.

Topics will include: supervaluationist semantics; data semantics for epistemic modals; attempts to find a common semantical framework for classical and intuitionistic logic; possibility semantics; inquisitive semantics; truth-maker semantics; information-state semantics.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will be devoted to a close reading of Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception. The central concern of the course will be to understand Merleau-Ponty’s importance for contemporary philosophy as well as cognitive science.We will use the new Donald A Landes translation of Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge 2012). Two other books are required: Komarine Romdenh-Romluc’s Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Merleau-Ponty and Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge 2011), and Reading Merleau-Ponty, edited by Thomas Baldwin (Routledge 2007). These three books have been ordered at University Press Books, 2430 Bancroft Way, in Berkeley.We will begin in the first class with the famous “Preface” to the Phenomenology of Perception and then reread it for the last meeting in light of having read the whole text. For the first class, please also read the first chapters of Romdenh-Romluc and Baldwin.This is a graduate research course and is intended for graduate students of philosophy. It will be open to others only by permission of the instructor.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaMy plan for this seminar is to read some new things on the problem of freedom and determinism, or, as I prefer, causation.  One wlll be a draft of a book I am trying to write, Wretched Subterfuge.  Jenann Ismael is also working on a new book on the topic, which I hope we can read.  She may also may be able to attend a number of the seminars.  Finally, there is a new anthology coming out editted by John Fischer, and I’ll try to get ahold of some of the papers in it.
In addition, we’ll read some of the classics, from Hume to van Inwagen, Ginet, and Wes Holliday.
As you can see, I don’t have the details worked out, but this will give potential members of the seminar what I have in mind.

The basic idea is that some reasons or requirements have a constitutive connection with the claims or entitlements of another party. It is natural to think that some of the requirements of special relationships like friendship have this character, and it is also familiar from contractual arrangements within private law. According to the relational interpretation, this kind of relational structure is also characteristic of moral requirements, which are connected to the claims of other individuals that the agent should comply with them. A consequence is that if I violate a moral requirement, I will not merely have done something that is wrong, I will have violated a claim that someone has against me, thereby wronging them in particular. We will discuss the attractions of understanding morality in these terms, as well as the challenges that the relational interpretation faces. Among other things, we will look at some of the differences between morality and other relational domains, such as friendship and private law, which might lead to skepticism about a relational account of the moral. We will also look at some broader normative implications of understanding morality in relational terms, for issues such as imperfect duties and duties to future generations.Texts will include relevant work by Robert Adams, Stephen Darwall, H. L. A. Hart, Derek Parfit, T. M. Scanlon, Michael Thompson, Gary Watson, and Susan Wolf, as well as new draft material on the topic of the seminar by the instructor.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe’ll look at some new puzzles about the interaction of modality with quantification and description, using them as excuses to learn about the following topics: quantification, description, reference, counterfactual modalities, the language of knowledge, logical consequence, the semantics-pragmatics boundary, and debates about the broad shape of an adequate theory of meaning for natural language—in particular, the issue of whether it takes a dynamic form. We’ll also make contact in important ways with a question of particular interest to a number of philosophical projects, namely, the question how certain fragments of talk can fail to be fully factual.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy–and, for the uninitiated, to philosophy itself. We will spend almost all of our time on the three most important Greek philosophers–Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle–with a passing glance at pre-Socratic and Hellenistic philosophers. Our primary goal will be to understand these philosophers’ characteristic methods and views, and (more importantly) their reasons for holding these views. It is often said that we should study ancient Greek philosophy because it is the intellectual basis for all later western philosophy and natural science. That is true, but it is only half the story. We should also study ancient Greek philosophy to become familiar with a worldview so alien that it throws our own into sharp relief. As you are outraged by some of the things these philosophers say, you will come to see more clearly what your own views are, and you will be forced to ask what justifies them. You will not just be studying the history of philosophy; you will be doing philosophy. Prerequisite: None.Previously taught:

What is worth valuing?  What does justice demand of us?  These are among the most difficult, and often disconcerting, questions that we face.  In this course, we will try to face them philosophically, by considering the answers proposed by some of the greatest thinkers in the history of the subject: Plato, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, Sidgwick and Nietzsche. This course presupposes no prior work in philosophy — only a willingness to think carefully, critically, and in an open-minded spirit.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhen we focus on certain facts about ourselves, e.g. that we bleed and sneeze and have to eat, it is easy to think of ourselves as purely physical beings. This is because sneezing, bleeding and eating are all able to be understood as purely physical processes. When we think of ourselves this way we understand ourselves as, in a certain sense, ultimately the same as the tables, chairs and other things able to be purchased at Ikea: we are just hunks of matter.Other things that we do resist this sort of understanding. We feel pain, we see the light change from green to red and decide to bring the car to a stop, we have pangs of sadness, of anxiety and of jubilation. In short we have a conscious mental life the variety and quality of which is difficult to put in to words. From this perspective it is very difficult to see ourselves as merely hunks of matter, as a bunch of atoms banging around in the void. How could pain just be a bunch of atoms banging around? How could the joy I feel be a purely physical process? When we focus on our mental lives it becomes extremely puzzling how we could be purely physical in nature.Here is the question we will ask in this course: can we acknowledge the fact that we have a conscious mental life within a theoretical understanding of ourselves according to which we are purely physical in nature? Another way of asking this question is: what is the relation between the mind and the physical world? Is the mind a part of the physical world? Is our mental life just another physical process like digestion? Or is it rather that the mind is non-physical in nature and hence that it cannot be accounted for in physical terms?Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to the philosophical thought of ancient Greece. We will approach a broad range of philosophical questions by examining and writing about the philosophy of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient authors. Among the questions we will ask are: What does reality consist in, and how do we know about it? What is the nature of knowledge? What is the structure of the soul? What is virtue, and how does one acquire it? And what is required to lead a good life? We study these foundational questions of metaphysics, epistemology and ethics through the eyes of ancient philosophers because they were the first to ask these questions, and the first to devise methods for answering them which are continuous with our philosophical practice today. For this reason, the course serves as a good introduction to philosophical thought and method generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.Previously taught:

What role, if any, should the notion of truth play in explaining what it is for our sentences to mean what they do?All of these questions presuppose that there are facts of the matter about what our words mean, or at least a difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises. But we will also examine arguments questioning these assumptions. Are there any determinate facts of the matter about what our words mean? If not, is there, after all, any real difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises? Readings will include work by Frege, Grice, Putnam, Burge, Quine, Kripke, Davidson, Searle, Strawson, Lewis, and others.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will raise a few of the central questions of moral and political philosophy. How should I live my life? What do I owe to others? What rules should we accept for living together? And, most fundamentally, should we think there are right and wrong answers to these questions?
We will also explore canonical answers given to these questions. Historical authors discussed in this course may include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Hume, Bentham, and Nietzsche, while more recent authors may include Bernard Williams, Judith Jarvis Thomson, John Rawls, and Robert Nozick.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis class is an introduction to the fundamental issues in the study of mind. Appeals to mental states are ubiquitous in our every day life: “I really wanted to see the new Woody Allen movie, but I was quite disappointed.” “If you believe that equality is important, you should come to the protest on Saturday.”  “Can you give me an Aspirin, I have a splitting headache.” “I just experienced the most beautiful sunset.” Fundamental to our understanding of others and ourselves is the fact that we’re conscious beings with minds and that our conscious mental states explain our behaviors and are essential to our identities. But what is consciousness and what does it mean to have a mind? What are mental states such as beliefs and desires and perceptions? How does the mind fit into the ordinary physical universe that is composed entirely of soul-less atoms? Is there room for consciousness within a scientific worldview? Do our mental states ever genuinely cause our behavior or are they mere shadows of our purely mechanistic brains?In this class, we will learn about different views of consciousness, including Dualism, Behaviorism, Identity Theory and Functionalism. Along the way, we will consider powerful objections that have been posed to each of these views, always with an eye to understanding what the central challenge is to making room for consciousness in the natural order of things.   This is an introductory class in philosophy and so we will also learn the basic tools of philosophical thinking and writing. No prerequisites.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. It provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek philosophical thinking from its pre-Socratic beginnings through the works of Aristotle. The course will be divided in to four sections: We will read, discuss, and write about the views of [1] an important group of pre-Socratic thinkers, [2] Socrates (469 – 399 BC), [3] Plato (427-347 BC), and [4] Aristotle (384-322 BC) on a wide variety of topics including: the nature of the universe, how to investigate reality, the nature of knowledge, the structure of the soul, the nature of virtue, and what is required to lead a good life. Since these issues are foundational for the Western philosophical tradition, the course may also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally. This course is required for the philosophy major, but has no prerequisites, and no prior philosophical experience will be presupposed. Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will explore topics in the philosophy of art. What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century).Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis introductory class will examine the works of four classical protagonists of Western political thought: Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. In focusing on early modern political philosophy and, in particular, on social contract theory, it is meant to provide students with a basic understanding of paradigmatic politico-philosophical approaches: An understanding of the underlying metaphysical and ontological, historical and anthropological assumptions that essentially inform these approaches; of the relevance and specific meaning of concepts such as freedom, equality, and justice, citizenship, community, and power; and, most importantly, of differing argumentative strategies of justifying the existence as well as the authority of the state philosophically. Thus, based on a careful reading of their writings, it is to be considered how Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, and Kant attempt to find a balance that resolves the inescapable tension between the autonomy of the individual and the authority of the state. Additionally, the course aims at identifying the concepts of the political that, implicitly or explicitly, organize the theories discussed.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAs taught this semester, Philosophy 134 will satisfy Group D of the Theory of Knowledge/Epistemology/Metaphysics requirement.  How is the meaning of a whole sentence determined by the meanings of its parts, and by its structure? This question is addressed in empirical semantic theories for natural language. The character and content of such theories has been a central concern both of the philosophy of language and of recent linguistics, and it is the central focus of this course. Students will become familiar with truth-conditional semantics for natural language in the model-theoretic tradition stemming from the classic work of Frege and Tarski and developed by Montague, Davidson, Lewis, and others. We will investigate the proper treatment of predicates, modifiers, quantifiers, modals, conditionals, names, descriptions, and attitudes within this kind of approach to linguistic meaning. Along this the way we will: develop a sense of what it means for a semantic theory to be compositional; ask how debates within a compositional semantic theory interact with foundational questions in the philosophy of language; and develop a conception of how natural language semantics relates to syntax, to pragmatics, and to psychological theories of human cognition.Philosophy 12A (introduction to logic) is a prerequisite to this course.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course is an intermediate level introduction into Aristotle’s philosophy, consisting of an examination of his main philosophical writings. We will cover parts of his logic, philosophy of science, and philosophy of nature. The second part of the course will be devoted to selected topics in Aristotle’s metaphysics (substance, potentiality/actuality, and the argument for a first unmoved mover in Metaphysics XII). Requirements: 25A, active participation, and occasionally the presentation of secondary literature.  Required text: A New Aristotle Reader, ed. J. L. Ackrill, 1987.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will provide an intensive introduction to Descartes’s views on physics, metaphysics and epistemology. We will begin by examining some of Descartes’s early works on method, physics and physiology. We will then turn to an in-depth study of the Meditations, focusing on both Descartes’s epistemological project and his anti-scholastic metaphysics. We will supplement our study of the Meditations with readings from the Objections and Replies, the Principles, and several important pieces of secondary literature. Some of the issues we will discuss in this section include the method of doubt, the Cartesian circle, Descartes’s mode of presentation in the Meditations, the creation and ontological status of the eternal truths, the status of the human being, the nature of substance, and the real distinction between mind and body. After our study of the Meditations, we will examine Descartes’s physics as presented in the Principles.Previously taught:

Students will be expected to read widely and carefully in Hume’s writings and to discuss and write clearly about them and the problems they raise.  Completion of at least Philosophy 25B is strongly advised, but not a prerequisite.  The richer one’s background in philosophy, and the more one reads and thinks and discusses with others, the more one will get from the course.  There is a large body of secondary literature on Hume that can be very helpful, but the emphasis in the course will be on the words and ideas of Hume himself.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will discuss some issues at the intersection of metaphysics and philosophy mind concerning space, time and consciousness. The overarching question of the course will be - what is the relationship between the fundamental spatial-temporal arena in which physical events occur, and the “manifest image” of space and time we find in human experience? More specifically, we will spend much of the course considering two recent debates. The first concerns the “spatial functionalist” position put forward by David Chalmers, on which manifest macro-spatio-temporal relations need not be the same as fundamental spatial-temporal relations. The second concerns the appearance of time’s passage: some claim that we experience the present moment as, in some sense, “moving through time”, and that this experience gives us evidence about the real nature of time. In particular, it gives us reason to believe that time involves “passage” in a strong sense (although some think the evidence is misleading - “time’s passage is an illusion”). We will assess this argument, appealing to considerations from metaphysics, philosophy of perception, epistemology, and cognitive science. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe seminar will cover in detail some basic results in proof theory. We will use the original articles by Gerhard Gentzen (1909–1945), who founded both structural proof theory and ordinal proof theory. In structural proof theory we will cover, among other things, the natural deduction calculus, the sequent calculus, cut-elimination and mid-sequent theorem for the sequent calculus, and various applications of such results. In ordinal proof theory we will study, among other things, Gentzen’s consistency proof for first-order Peano Arithmetic using ordinal induction up to epsilon-zero. In addition, we will also read some other logical and philosophical articles by Gentzen and some secondary literature, where appropriate. The seminar will be of interest to philosophers, logicians, computer scientists, linguists and mathematicians. Through this material, philosophy students will acquire the tools required for tackling further debates in philosophy of mathematics (prospects for Hilbert’s program and its relativized versions etc.) and philosophy of logic and language (meaning of the logical constants; proof-theoretic semantics; realism/anti-realism, Dummett’s program (normalization, harmony etc.)). Graduate students in philosophy may use this course for satisfying the formal philosophy course requirement (i.e. a course in the 140 series or equivalent).The minimal requirement for taking the seminar is Philosophy 12A (Introduction to Logic), although a certain amount of logical/mathematical maturity (but no specific knowledge of advanced mathematics) will be necessary for mastering the material.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat should the philosophical study of the political be about? For some, the investigation of politics and political values is predominantly a matter of ‘logical analysis’. But could one really gain a proper insight into ethical ideals or political imperatives without a good sense of the historical and social settings in which they arise and continue to be expressed? If the realm of the political is defined by the common practical necessities which we all share, then a proper appreciation of our political values should also involve some historical explanation of how those necessities arise. But if so, how exactly are we to understand the relation between our political concepts (seemingly open to abstract reflection and analysis) and the historical contexts in which those concepts are embedded and out of which they arise? What role might ‘genealogy’ play in a philosophical method enriched by such historical sensitivity? Finally, once we have got used to seeking explanations in terms of our contingent histories, what room is left for offering what we can see as genuine justifications of values or policies?
These are some of the questions thrown up by Bernard Williams’s ethical and political philosophy. These concerns begin to surface in his earliest writings about political ideals, in papers on equality, freedom and toleration. But the methodological framework is given explicit formulation only much later in some of his works on both the nature of philosophy and politics. At the same time this perspective is put to work in his most practical and situated intellectual work: his reports on government committees devoted to issues ranging from education to pornography. And anyway, the reflections on the political are set in proper context only through consideration of his broader concerns with ethics and moral philosophy, particularly his critique of utilitarianism.
So the aim of this seminar is work through Williams’s puzzling away at these questions: at different points of his intellectual career; in works of concrete practical issues and the most abstract methodological reflections; in works explicitly concerned with the political, and debates about the foundations and nature of ethics.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of California‘My earliest memory is dipped in red. I come out of a door on the arm of a maid, the floor in front of me is red, and to the left a staircase goes down, equally red. Across from us, at the same height, a door opens, and a smiling man steps forth, walking towards me in a friendly way. He steps right up close to me, halts, and says: “Show me your tongue.” I stick out my tongue, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out a jackknife, opens it, and brings the blade all the way to my tongue. He says: “Now we’ll cut off his tongue.” I don’t dare pull back my tongue, he comes closer and closer, the blade will touch me any second. In the last moment, he pulls back the knife, saying: “Not today, tomorrow.” He snaps the knife shut again and puts it back in his pocket.
Every morning, we step out of the door and into the red hallway, the door opens, and the smiling man appears. I know what he’s going to say and I wait for the command to show my tongue. I know he’s going to cut it off, and I get more and more scared each time. That’s how the day starts, and it happens very often.’This seminar has two interrelated themes. First, recent debates about the nature of action and about sensory experience have focused on the need to pay due attention to the categories in which action and experience fall: that it is important to recognize that these are events or processes as opposed to states. We’ll look at these claims – advanced by, among others, Michael Thompson, Jennifer Hornsby, Helen Steward, and Matthew Soteriou – in the context of the original views about the metaphysics of temporal entities first proposed by Anthony Kenny and Zeno Vendler, and then revised by Alexander Mourelatos.
Second, we’ll explore the role that ‘the autobiographical notion of experience’ (as Hinton labelled it) informs our common conception of the relation between sense experience, action and self-consciousness. Here too we’ll apply some morals about the categories of mental phenomena.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will be concerned with various problems in the philosophy
of mind, beginning with the problems of consciousness. We will discuss
some recent approaches to consciousness as well as some theories about
the relation of consciousness to the unconscious and the role of
mentalist explanations involving consciousness both in social sciences
and in common sense.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this seminar, we will be focusing on Kant’s transcendental idealism, his particular version of the view that the objects of knowledge are appearances rather than things-in-themselves.    We will concentrate on the relevant sections in the Critique of Pure Reason, but we will also look at other works by Kant in order to get a better sense of the philosophical use he wants to make of idealism. We will be looking closely at the arguments Kant presents for this doctrine, with an eye to determining what role is played in these arguments by the passivity or receptivity of sensibility and what role by his views about our representation of space and time.    We will also be discussing a wide range of different interpretations of Kant’s idealism found in secondary literature by, among others, Strawson, Allison, Guyer, Langton, and Ameriks.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is designed as a workshop for the presentation and discussion of work-in-progress in moral, political, and legal theory. The central aim of the course is to provide an opportunity for students to engage directly with philosophers, political theorists, and legal scholars working on normative questions. Another aim is to create a space that brings together people from different disciplines who have strong normative interests or who speak to issues philosophers and theorists should know something about.  Toward this goal, we will devote a few sessions to featuring the work of economists, historians, psychologists, sociologists, and other social scientists.The format of the course will be as follows. For the first two hours of the course, a student will lead off with a 15-minute comment on the presenter’s paper and the presenter will have 5-10 minutes to respond before we open up the discussion to the entire assembled group.  The first two hours will be open to non-enrolled students and faculty who wish to participate in the workshop discussion. At the end of the two hours, those who are not enrolled will leave, and for the third hour of the course, the guest presenter will continue the discussion with students enrolled in the course.  Enrolled students must serve as a discussant for at least one presenter’s work-in-progress and write several short response papers and a final paper of 15-20 pages.The course is room-shared with the Law School and the Political Science Department.  This  course will follow the Law academic calendar.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe aim of this course will be to explore certain traditional problems in the philosophy of mind in terms of recent work in philosophy and cognitive science. We will be discussing such traditional problems as the mind-body problem, the nature of intentionality, and the nature of consciousness in light of recent discussions which use computer models of cognition or which try to cast doubt on our ordinary, common-sense conceptions of the mental. These views include functionalism, artificial intelligence, eliminative materialism, parallel distributed processing, and others.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to (primarily) analytical legal theory through a close reading of some of the most important texts and arguments about the nature of law and legal authority of the last 50 years. We will pay special attention to questions of the relation of law to politics, history, and morality, and to questions about the philosophical justification (if there is) for the special role of courts in maintaining political order. Among the authors we will read are: H.L.A. Hart, Hans Kelsen, Ronald Dworkin, Jurgen Habermas, Joseph Raz, Scott Shapiro, Seana Shiffrin, and Jeremy Waldron. The course presupposes no prior work in philosophy or legal theory.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAs taught this semester, this course may satisfy the 160-187  requirement for the major.Nietzsche’s approach to the question of the meaning of life was centered around a radical rethinking of the relation between ethics and aesthetics as the two main areas of human self-expression. Already his early account of the Apollonian and the Dionysian art drives aimed at a model that would foster both sources of energy within a productive unity. Later on in his ‘Zarathustra’ and other less ‘literary’ writings Nietzsche questions deep-seated metaphysical and psychological assumptions about selfhood and personal development. Nietzsche’s genealogical approach to morality, intertwined as it is with the question of aesthetic ‘education’, provokes us to rethink the question of valuing at the basis of ethics and aesthetics. Texts to be studied include the ‘The Birth of the Tragedy’, ‘Thus Spoke Zarathustra’, the ‘Genealogy of Morals’, and excerpts from other writings and late notes. [We will also look at some recent papers by leading Nietzsche scholars relevant to the discussed topic.]Admission to the seminar is by instructor’s approval only.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaNote: As taught this semester, Philosophy 108 will satisfy the Ethics requirement.As a thoughtful person, living in this country, at this time, you have at some point asked yourself some of the following questions. Should torture be allowed? Is there any difference between terrorism and “collateral damage”? May we kill enemy soldiers or even civilians to protect ourselves? Is capital punishment moral? Is abortion? Whether or not it’s moral, should it be legal? Should we let the majority or the courts decide? Is the government allowed to take your money and use it in ways you don’t want? If you have better grades and higher test scores, do you deserve a spot at UC more? Are you allowed to buy yourself an iPod when you could use the money to save people from starving? Should you buy a hybrid, rather than an SUV, when your individual choice is just “a drop in the bucket” and won’t really affect global warming?These questions can be difficult for many different reasons. Self- interest, prejudice, and fear can cloud our judgment. Religious authorities that we accept on faith, such as the Bible, can give unclear or conflicting directions. Finally, it can be hard to be sure of relevant facts: for example, whether information gained through torture tends to be reliable, whether the justice system applies the death penalty consistently, or whether burning fossil fuels leads to climate change.This course, however, is about another set of difficulties, which persist when we set aside our personal feelings, we see how far we can get without relying on faith, and we assume that we know the relevant facts. We may not be able to decide, by our own reflection and reasoning, which answers are correct, and even when we are sure that certain answers are correct, we may not be able to justify them. Our ethical ideas may seem not up to the task. Our aim in this course is to come to terms with these difficulties and to see to what extent they can be overcome.Previously taught:

In what ways are they still of relevance to life in the twenty-first century? The course will consider the contemporary implications of Confucius’ teachings for such topics as: family, rituals, life and death, fate, contentment and anxiety, anger and resentment, courage, respectfulness, modesty and humility, trustworthiness, learning, self-cultivation, semblances of virtue. In addition to reading selected passages from the Analects, we will also consider commentaries by later Confucians and read contemporary philosophical articles on the relevant topics.Required Readings D.C.

We start with an introduction to the philosophy of space and time, through the  correspondence of Leibniz and Clarke. Next we examine logical positivism, confirmationism,  falsificationism, and realism and anti-realism about scientific theories and entities. We then  spend some time analyzing Kuhn’s notion of scientific revolutions, and consider a case study in  the history of science: the Copernican revolution. We come full circle and revisit the philosophy  of space and time from the standpoint of 20th century physics, including empirical and  theoretical results, and consider the new world view in the light of special relativity.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will review central issues in theory of meaning, in particular the relation between meaning and reference to objects.  What explains our ability to refer to objects?  Is the ability to think about an object a matter of standing in an appropriate causal relation to it?  And if we take this view, does it help us to understand how thought might be in the end a biological phenomenon?  We will look at basic lines of thought set out here by Kripke and Fodor, and theorists who have built on their ideas.  We will also look at the contrasting view of meaning and reference presented by the later Wittgenstein.
We will begin, though, with the accounts of reference set out by Frege and Russell.Previously taught:

Students will be expected to devote significant time and effort to writing.We will cover a range of topics. First, we will ask: what is a mind, and what is it to have a mind? Next, we will examine the connection between knowledge of one’s own mental states and knowledge of the mental states of others. We will then turn to some questions in moral philosophy: What general principles, if any, tell us what is the morally right or wrong thing to do? When does an agent deserve praise for doing the right thing? Finally, we will turn to Hume’s famous problem of induction, or, the problem of justifying our inferences from observed matters of facts to unobserved matters of fact, and we will examine contemporary responses to this problem.This course fulfills the university’s second-semester reading and composition (R&C) requirement.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this introductory course we will be looking at the relation of psychological states, such as desires or memories, to the physical world. There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a non-physical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe all are acquainted with people who think they know far more about important things than they really do. But what if we are such people? How do we know whether our beliefs are really knowledge, or just an accumulation of superstition and half-truths inherited from parents, culture, peer-groups and the like? Philosophers have taken such self-questioning to extremes. Do I know that there is an external world? That I really exist? That the world wasn’t created five years, or five minutes, ago, with lots of misleading evidence about being older? We will look at the structure of knowledge, doubts philosophers have had about it, and helpful positive accounts of its nature that have emerged.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe aim of this course is to apply the concepts and methodology of contemporary philosophy to basic questions in the philosophy of religion, with an emphasis on the Western philosophical and religious traditions. This includes questions concerning the nature and existence of God, the contrast between faith and reason, the nature of religious experience, the possibility of life after death, the incomprehensibility of God, and the relationship between God and morality. The course readings will primarily be contemporary, though there will be some historical readings, and the course material will be arranged topically rather than chronologically.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will cover some of the main metaphysical and epistemological views of five important early modern philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Hume and Kant. We will be concerned with their views on the existence of God, on the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, on the possibility of knowledge about the external world, on the nature of bodies, on causation and induction, and on other related topics. We will try to understand these views in the context of the scientific developments of the time, in particular that of the “new science” which supplanted the Aristotelian view of nature in the seventeenth century. But we will also be concerned with whether or not these views are plausible in their own right. The course will require close reading of the texts, and careful analysis and evaluation of the philosophical arguments presented in them.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will be devoted to a close examination of some of the central themes of Plato’s metaphysics and epistemology.  The topics to be covered will include the theory of Forms, the doctrine the learning is recollection, the distinction between knowledge and belief, the nature and role of perception, and the treatment of non-being.  We will discuss the treatment of these topics in Plato’s Phaedo, Republic, Cratylus, Theaetetus, Sophist and Parmenides. Required Texts:
Plato: Complete Works, edited by John M. Cooper (Hackett: 1997).
Plato 1: Metaphysics and Epistemology, edited by Gail Fine (Oxford:  1999).Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn upper-division course in the philosophical theory of knowledge.  Not a general survey of the field, but an investigation of three fundamental epistemological questions about perceptual knowledge.
-How does what we perceive give us knowledge of what is so
in the world around us at that very time?
-How does what we have perceived give us knowledge of
what is so but is not being perceived at the moment?
-How does what each of us perceives about other people give
us knowledge of the thoughts, feelings, and attitudes of
those people?
There is a long tradition in philosophy according to which the most anyone is ever aware of in sense-perception alone are certain features of our perceptual experiences, not the ways things are in the independent world we all believe in.  This has made it look as if perceptual knowledge of those aspects of the world is, strictly speaking, impossible.  This course investigates the support for this conception of perceptual experience and its “skeptical” implications for our knowledge of familiar objects around us, our knowledge of things we are not perceiving to be so at the moment, and our knowledge of other people’s thoughts, feelings, and attitudes.  The challenge is to understand how, given the distinctively philosophical character of the epistemological problems, we nonetheless do have perceptual knowledge of these aspects of the independent world. 
Two lecture-discussion classes and one discussion section each week.  Students will be expected to write three five-page papers, one on each of the three topics, as well as whatever writing is assigned in connection with discussion sections.  Lectures and discussions will presuppose close reading of the material contained in a Philosophy 122 reader (available at the beginning of the semester) as well as supplementary reading suggested at different points during the semester.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments? What is the nature of perception? This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is a close examination of the structure of Spinoza’s philosophical system. Most of our time will be spent on a careful reading of Spinoza’s Ethics Demonstrated in Geometric Order, in which Spinoza argues for a comprehensive philosophical system that encompasses metaphysics, epistemology, psychology and ethics. Our primary goal will be to come to a deep understanding of Spinoza’s philosophical views, the relation of these views to those of his contemporaries, and the relevance of his views to contemporary philosophical theories.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will examine some of the major metaphysical and epistemological themes of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. We will be focusing particularly on Kant’s views on the following topics: a priori knowledge and how it is possible, space and time, objectivity and experience, self-knowledge, and transcendental idealism and the contrast between appearances and things in themselves. Several short papers and two longer papers will be required.Prerequisite: Philosophy 25B [History of Modern Philosophy (17th&18th centuries)Texts: Required: Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, translated by Norman Kemp Smith; Kant, Prolegomena, translated by Gary Hatfield; Recommended: Henry Allison, Kant’s Transcendental Idealism,  2nd edition (Yale Univ.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe seminar will focus on the relations between language, art, poetry, and technology in Heidegger’s later philosophy. His diagnosis of our ‘forgetfulness of being’ will be explored in the context of his interpretations of Hölderlin and Nietzsche, both of whom grappled with the ‘nihilism’ latent in modernity (‘destitute times’/’The desert grows’). Particular attention will be paid to Heidegger’s focus on the role of works of art and poetry, ‘things’, and ‘mindful thinking’ as opening up possible ways out of this condition. However, our discussion of Heidegger’s texts will also have to take into account some of the deeply troubling ‘thinking’ entries recently published in the so-called ‘Black Notebooks’.Readings will include such central essays as The Origin of the Work of Art, What are Poets for?, The Question Concerning Technology, The Thing, and On the Way to Language.Required texts: the essay collections Martin Heidegger. Poetry, Language, Thought (transl. Hofstadter), and Martin Heidegger. The Question Concerning Technology and other Essays (transl. William Lovitt). Additional texts will be made available on bCourses.Enrollment is limited, and by application only. The seminar is aimed at advanced students of philosophy, preferably with some background in Heidegger and/or Nietzsche. Students should apply to the instructor directly (at kuk@berkeley.edu). Applications should include a brief statement outlining the applicant’s philosophical background (courses taken) and interest in the seminar. All applicants will be notified via email as to the result of their application before the beginning of the new term; those admitted will receive course entry codes (CECs) with which they can enroll in the seminar through TeleBears.As taught this semester, this course satisfies the 160-187 (but not the 160-178) requirement for the major.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThebulk of the course will be taken up with a close study of Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy, with attention to related passages in the Objections and Replies, the Principles of Philosophy, and others of Descartes’s works.  We will focus on the following issues:  skepticism and its overcoming; rationalist epistemology and foundationalism; the nature of mental representation (i.e. the theory of ideas); the real distinction between mind and body; the foundations of mathematical/mechanistic science; and the existence and providence of God.  There will be a brief survey at the beginning of the course of the relevant background to the Meditations, with short selections from St. Thomas Aquinas and Francis Suarez (the Scholastic background) and from Galileo (the scientific background).  The course will end with a brief consideration of the work of one of Descartes’s earliest and most important successors, Nicolas Malebranche, both to trace some of Descartes’s influence and to highlight the distinctiveness of his views.Course readings:

He was talking particularly about causation in biology.  Generally in current discussions of physical causation, people take it that ideas relating to probability, counterfactuals and processes or mechanisms all likely have some role to play in understanding what causation is, though of course it’s always instructive to see someone trying to do the whole thing in terms of one key concept alone.  When we consider mental causation, the ways in which mental states cause one another, do we have just the same amiable jumble, or are there quite different ideas that need to be injected?  My main point in this book is that there are some quite stark differences between physical causation and causation in the mind:(1)  In understanding physical causation, we seem to need a concept of ‘causal process’.  Similar arguments that seem to show this also apply to the mental case.  But here the concept of ‘causal process’ that we need seems strikingly different to the physical conception.(2)  In understanding high-level causation in the physical world, we seem to need a notion of ‘systematic relatedness’ of cause variables and effect variables, but the concept of ‘proportionality’ that we need in the mental case seems not quite the same as the concept we need in the physical case.(3)  In explaining what physical causation is, we seem to need some concept of ‘intervention’.  But there are differences between the types of intervention that are available in the physical case and those that are available in the psychological case.  There is some overlap, however.What underlies these differences between causality in the mind and physical causation is the difference between the mind as a target of imaginative understanding, and the physical as a target of scientific explanation, not dependent on taking the ‘point of view’ of another.Of course, what we say on these points has ramifications for virtually every topic in the philosophy of mind, from functionalism to the philosophy of perception, personal identity and freedom of the will.  The key issues in all these areas are usually framed as though we have a univocal concept of causation, which applies to both mentalistic and physical phenomena.  A better understanding of mental causation won’t of itself dissolve the original puzzles, but without it we couldn’t resolve them.  We’ll work through some of the key questions in philosophy of causation as they apply to the mentalistic case, such as the relation between causality and law, or causality and process, and we’ll look at their application to some urgent practical questions in psychiatry, as well as more familiar philosophical issues.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAristotle’s theory of science crucially relies on the assumption that sense perception provides us with a reliable cognitive grasp of particular physical objects, i.e. ordinary middle sized 3-D objects such as chairs, tables, dogs, people, mountains, and so on. However, in his zoological account of sense perception in the De Anima Aristotle almost gives the impression as if he was more interested in modally specific sense perception and its causal ancestry than in the perception of objects. How does he arrive from the affection of peripheral sense organs by external objects to the perception of objects? And what exactly is the perception of objects for Aristotle? In this seminar we will examine these questions, approaching his account of sense perception at first as a part of his natural philosophy. Thus, after a very brief historical survey of earlier theories, we will start with some of the basics of his (qualitative) metaphysics of nature insofar as they are relevant for our purposes, most importantly his account of motion / change as the common actuality of the active and passive relata of change, and his idea of the perceptual soul as a principle of change. Hopefully, this will give us a sense of what he might have thought the task of a theory of perception consist in. We will then examine his account of sense perception proper, proceeding roughly along the following stages: perception and affection / the capacity – approach to perception / the material basis of perception / different kinds of ‘objects’ of perception / the individuation of the senses / perceptual discrimination and basic perceptual content / perceptual awareness as the presence of the perceptual form in the perceiver / object perception/ the roles of the imagination in perception.
Here are some (short) passages for a preparatory reading for the first few sessions: (1) De Anima I 2-5 (the discussion of the predecessors on the soul), (2) Physics III 1-3 (the definition of motion / change, or process, kinêsis), (3) De Anima II 1-4 (the most common definition of the soul, and the so-called causal definition of the soul via the powers of the soul), (4) De Anima II 5 (general introduction into the treatment of the power of perception, remarks on the relation between process and perception), (5) Physics VII 2-3 (further remarks on the relation between processes and perception, and the relation between processes and forms and states).Requirements: Phil. 161 or equivalent. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaAn exploratory seminar on the conditions, or possibility, of understanding central aspects or domains of human thought “from outside” them, without accepting or commitment to what is held to be so within the domain in question.  Particular topics to be explored in detail include: the use, meaning, and understanding of words; knowing and saying what a certain expression means; the relation between understanding an expression and competence in linguistic performance; taking something as a reason to believe, or to do, something; believing, or doing, something for a reason; making evaluative judgements; holding perceptual beliefs; having perceptual knowledge; believing that certain things are necessarily so.  For further exploration are the philosophical implications of finding oneself unable to understand or explain a particular domain of thought “from outside” it, without presupposing competence and commitment within it.Readings from the works of Nagel, Davidson, Wittgenstein, Dummett, Kripke, Quine, McDowell, Scanlon, Dworkin, Dretske, Stroud, and others.Active participation is expected of those in attendance.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThere is a growing body of empirical and philosophical research that suggests that ordinary human agency (including moral dispositions) is profoundly affected by the structural, material, and social conditions in which agents operate. The aspiration of this seminar is to think carefully about the implications of this idea. If our moral dispositions and agential capacities aren’t just features of individual agents considered in themselves, but features of agents in contexts, this has consequences for a range of issues in moral psychology, the theory of moral responsibility, and political and legal philosophy. So, we’ll be looking at questions of blame, culpability, norm adoption, and egalitarianism in light of these and related ideas. We’ll also be considering what obligations we may have for shaping our contexts of action in light of findings about the “ecological” nature of human beings. Readings will draw from work moral psychology, ethics, decision theory, the history of philosophy, philosophy of action, and political philosophy. The seminar will start with recent work by John Doris and the instructor. Other readings may include selections from Bichierri, Hacking, McGeer, Pettit, Pippin, and Scheffler, as well as works in the social sciences, and feminist and critical theory approaches to agency.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe first part of the course will be devoted to a study of early Chinese thought, with focus on Confucianism (Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi) and Daoism (Zhuangzi), though there will also be references to other schools of thought. While we will attend closely to texts, including a discussion of the connotations of key terms and an analysis of important passages, the emphasis is on philosophical ideas in the texts. All readings will be in English translation and the course does not require prior knowledge of Chinese.The second part of the course will be devoted to a philosophical discussion of themes in moral psychology that relate to Chinese thought. We will start with a methodological discussion of the way to bridge Chinese traditions of thought and contemporary philosophical discussions (primarily in the Anglo-American tradition). We will then engage in a sustained discussion of a cluster of related themes in moral psychology, such as: purity and sincerity, tranquility and equanimity, detachment, death and grief, resentment and forgiveness, acceptance as a way of coping with adversities, idea of ‘losing the self’, etc.The overall goal of the course is to provide an understanding of Chinese traditions of thought in their proper historical and cultural contexts, and to illustrate a way of doing philosophical work with these traditions that does justice to their distinctive characteristics and insights.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn his 1982 book, Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language, Kripke claims that the relation between the meaning of an expression and its use is normative rather than descriptive.  This claim has prompted a lively debate about the so-called “normativity of meaning” and the associated thesis, also sometimes ascribed to Kripke, that mental content is normative.  Do ascriptions of meaning and content have implications for how people ought to use expressions or what propositional attitudes they should be in, and, if so, what are the implications for reductionist accounts of meaning and content?  In this seminar we will investigate this debate with an eye to the question of what it might mean to say that meaning is normative: in particular, what Kripke meant by it, and what Kripke’s interpreters have understood him to mean by it.  By looking at the normativity thesis in the context of Kripke’s interpretation of Wittgenstein, we will try to get clearer about some of the positions in the debate and about whether meaning really is normative in a sense which poses a threat to semantic reductionism.  We will begin by reading Wittgenstein and Kripke; subsequent readings are yet to be determined, but are likely to include writings by some of the following: Boghossian, Millikan, McDowell, Stroud, Horwich, Brandom, Gibbard, Hattiangadi, Glüer and Wikforss.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will focus on key arguments in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaA workshop for presenting and discussing work in progress in moral, political, and legal theory.  The central aim is to provide an opportunity for students to engage with philosophers, political theorists, and legal scholars working on normative questions.  Another aim is to bring together people from different disciplines who have strong normative interests or who speak to issues of potential interest to philosophers and political theorists.  To this end, we will devote a few sessions to the work of economists, historians, psychologists, sociologists, or other social scientists.Format: for the first two hours, a student will lead off with a 15-minute comment on the presenter’s paper and the presenter will have 5-10 minutes to respond before we open up the discussion to the group.  The first two hours will be open to non-enrolled students and faculty. For the third hour, the guest presenter will continue the discussion with students enrolled in the course.  Enrolled students must serve as a discussant for at least one presenter’s work in progress and write several short response papers as well as a final paper of 15-20 pages. The course is room-shared with the Law School and the Philosophy Department.  This  course will follow the UC Berkeley general academic calendar.  The first class meeting is January 22nd and the the final class meeting is April 29th.

In this class, we’ll explore some of the most pressing contemporary questions in ethics and political philosophy.  In the first part of the class, we’ll discuss whether we’re morally required to donate to charity, whether (assisted) suicide, abortion, and eating meat are ever permissible, and when self-defense is justified.  In the second half of the class, we’ll discuss questions of a more political nature: the ethics of punishment, killing in war, terrorism, whether and to what extent we’re required to be tolerant of others’ views (e.g., must we be tolerant even of the intolerant?), and whether living in a society that treats one unjustly licenses acting in ways that would otherwise be impermissible.  Our goal in this class is not so much to settle any of these questions than to see how to think about them philosophically, highlighting some of the major themes of ethics and political philosophy as we do so, such as the longstanding debate between utilitarian and deontological ethical theories.Previously taught:

Of course, the little vacuum cleaner detects things—walls, for example. And it reacts accordingly—by turning, for example. This is, to be sure, a cute dance. But there is nothing it is like to be the dancer. The roomba doesn’t, for example, feel itself bump against the wall, or see itself turn away from it. (Go ahead and try to put yourself in the roomba’s shoes—try to imagine what it is like to be the roomba. There is nothing there to be imagined.)What is it like to be you? Here there is more to say. Of course, like the roomba, you detect things  and react accordingly. But, unlike the roomba, you also experience what’s around—you see, hear, taste, smell, and touch. What’s more, you have a rich inner life, full of thoughts, moods, and bodily sensations. You are, in short, conscious. The roomba is not. This difference between conscious and unconscious things seems deep and important. But how does it arise? What exactly is it about you that makes you conscious? And what’s missing in unconscious things, like the roomba? In this course, you will grapple with these and related questions about consciousness, and learn about philosophical (and some scientific) attempts to answer them. Along the way, you will learn how to read and write philosophy. This is an introductory course, with no prerequisites.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course, we will survey the beginnings of philosophy in the Western tradition with special attention to Socrates (469-399), Plato (427-347), Aristotle (384-322), and the Epicurean, Stoic, and Skeptical schools that flourished in the subsequent centuries. In particular, we will discuss their approaches to scientific knowledge, the structure of the world, and the good human life. Since the ancient Greeks identified many of the philosophical problems (and models for their resolution) we are still concerned with today, the course also serves as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis is an upper-level philosophy course focused on the mind. Science tells us that the world is made up of physical particles that follow natural laws. But how can the mind –and consciousness – fit into such a worldview? We will begin by looking at purported solutions to the mind-body problem (Dualism, Identity Theory, Behaviorism, Functionalism), noting how some of these theories have been influenced by fields like neurobiology and cognitive science. We will go on to discuss Intentionality (the mind’s ability to represent) and the related internalism-externalism debate about mental contents. Our next topic will be the epistemic puzzles related to the mind: whether there is an explanatory gap between the mental and the physical, and the problem of whether we can know anything about other minds. We will go on to talk about theories of consciousness, and we will end with a look at specific problems in the philosophy of mind: mental disorders, animal minds, and the strangeness of quantum mechanical interpretations of the mind.Previously taught:

It will be organized into three units.  In the first unit, we’ll consider questions concerning the nature of morality such as:  Are moral truths objective or rather personally or culturally relative?  Why should I act morally?  What does morality require of me?  In the second unit, we’ll look at some contemporary moral questions including:  Is abortion morally wrong?  What do we owe to future generations?  How demanding are our obligations to help strangers?  In the final unit, we’ll consider some questions in political philosophy including:  Why should I do what the state tells me to do?  What’s the nature and importance of toleration?  Why is free speech important in a political society?  Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaOut of all that exists in the universe, out of all of the rocks, stars, galaxies, and protons, almost nothing has any kind of mental life at all. As far as we now know, the only things in the entirety of the universe that have minds are some animals on planet Earth, ourselves included. This observation raises at least two serious questions. First, could things other than living animals like ourselves have minds, or be conscious? That’s one question, about the possible extent of mental features in the universe. A second, even deeper question, is why anything in our universe has any kind of inner mental life at all. Since so much of the universe operates in compete unfeeling darkness, why does anything in it have a mind? We are incredibly lucky to be among the things that have minds, that are conscious, that can think, feel, love, and reflect. But we, like everything else in the universe, are complex physical systems composed of mindless sub-atomic particles. Why do the mindless particles that compose my brain and body produce a conscious experience, while the mindless particles that compose a table, or a hurricane, or a galaxy generate nothing of the kind? These are both fundamental questions about what it takes for something to have a mind, which is the main them of this class. In the course we will examine some of the most fundamental questions about the nature of the mind. Topics that we will cover include the relationship between the mind and our physical bodies and brains (The Mind-Body Problem), and in particular the status of conscious experience in the physical world (The Problem of Consciousness). We will also look at the nature of perceptual experience, and the question of whether it accurately presents the world to us (The Problem of Perception), as well as the nature of the self, or the question of what a person is (The Problem of the Self).

You’ll learn how to represent the basic structure of arguments in a formal language, and then assess these arguments for correctness. We’ll cover the basic syntax and semantics of propositional logic and first-order logic, and develop a proof system for both. Metalogical results will be discussed but not proved. The emphasis is on using logical tools to hone everyday and philosophical reasoning.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. It provides an overview of the classical currents of ancient Greek philosophical thinking from its pre-Socratic beginnings through the works of Aristotle. The course will be divided in to four sections: We will read, discuss, and write about the views of [1] an important group of pre-Socratic thinkers, [2] Socrates (469 – 399 BC), [3] Plato (427-347 BC), and [4] Aristotle (384-322 BC) on a wide variety of topics including: the nature of the universe, how to investigate reality, the nature of knowledge, the structure of the soul, the nature of virtue, and what is required to lead a good life. Since these issues are foundational for the Western philosophical tradition, the course may also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking generally. This course is required for the philosophy major, but has no prerequisites, and no prior philosophical experience will be presupposed.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWhat distinguishes meaningful sounds and marks from meaningless ones? Are the meanings of our words to be explained in terms of the intentions with which we use them? Or are meanings determined in some other way? In what ways, if any, do the meanings of our words depend on features of our environment? Is the meaning of a word a thing in the world for which it can be said to stand? What is the relation between the meaning of a word and the meanings of sentences in which it occurs? What role, if any, should the notion of truth play in explaining what it is for our sentences to mean what they do?All of these questions presuppose that there are facts of the matter about what our words mean, or at least a difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises. But we will also examine arguments questioning these assumptions. Are there any determinate facts of the matter about what our words mean? If not, is there, after all, any real difference between meaningful utterances and meaningless noises? Readings will include work by Frege, Grice, Putnam, Burge, Quine, Kripke, Davidson, Searle, Strawson, Lewis, and others.Previously taught:

It seeks to addresses questions concerning the self, our relations to others and our commitment to various human communities. It asks, thus: How can I lead a good life? Are there rules for my relations with others? How are we to settle questions of social living together?We will examine these issues with the help of writings from both Western and Non-Western sources, both classical and modern authors. All the required readings will be made available in a Class Reader. In addition to the lectures there will be weekly one-hour sections to provide a space for a discussion of the issues that have come up. Participation in these sections is essential for success in the class.There will be three, one hour in-class exams and a regularly scheduled three hour final.Previously taught:

In what ways are they still of relevance to life in the twenty-first century? The course will consider the contemporary relevance of Confucius’ teachings for a number of selected topics. For this semester, the selected topics will revolve around the theme ‘no self’ or ‘losing the self’. In addition to reading passages from the Analects of Confucius, we will also consider elaborations on Confucius’ ideas by later Confucians, including Mencius (4th century B.C.) and Zhu Xi (1130-1200), as well as contemporary philosophical discussions of related topics such as: compassion, sympathy, empathy; humility, modesty; anger, resentment, forgiveness; detachment, tranquility. The goal is to provide an introduction to Confucius’ teachings and to key ideas in Confucian thought, as well as an understanding of the philosophical implications and contemporary relevance of Confucian ideas.Previously taught:

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to do that.  “Tangible” means perceivable by though.  Do all these phenomena that we use “means” to describe, have something in common?  What have philosophers taken meaning to be?  How does the phenomenon of meaning, or the phenomena of meaning, fit into a naturalistic account of the world?  If there is smoke, but no one around to perceive it, does it still mean fire?

What is the role of language in constituting human reality, and what is language anyhow? These and other related questions will be discussed in this course. The course deals with the foundations of the social sciences and the differences between social science explanations and natural science explanations.

It is divided into three parts. The first two parts are mathematical in style whereas the last part is philosophical. In the first part we will cover the basic notions of computability theory and study in detail the Turing machine approach to computability. The second part of the course will give a detailed presentation of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and related results. Finally, we will look at the philosophical relevance of these logical results to various areas of philosophy.

This course will be a study of some of the major philosophical texts from the Medieval Period with a focus on issues in metaphysics and epistemology. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which the philosophers in this period assimilate Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy into religious thought and how they anticipate certain aspects of modern philosophy. Topics will include the nature of universals, individuation, the nature and existence of God, faith and reason, skepticism, freedom, human nature and human cognition.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will be an in-depth study of Plato’s philosophy, focusing on two of his greatest dialogues, Republic and Theaeteus.    After an introduction on Plato’s intellectual and social context, we will spend eight weeks exploring the themes and structure of the Republic.  The work begins as a typical Socratic attempt to define a controversial term (in this case justice), and then morphs into a gigantic thought experiment involving education, theology, utopian politics, psychology, metaphysics, and eschatology.  How are we to evaluate this extraordinary project, taking it both in part and as a whole?    In the last weeks of the semester, we will study Plato’s path-breaking epistemology in the Theaetetus, paying particular attention to his refutation of epistemic relativism and Socrates’ systematic failure to define empirical knowledge.   Completion of Philosophy 25A is strongly advised.  The course will be examined by in-class mid-term and final papers, and a 5-7 page take-home essay.   Required books: Plato The Republic, ed. G.R.F.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis seminar will be an examination of various topics at the intersection of feminist theory and philosophy.   We will begin by considering some conceptual questions in feminist theory, such as: What is feminism?  What is sexism and oppression?  What is gender?  With this background in hand we will then explore some of the contributions that feminist philosophy has made to areas of traditional philosophical interest, especially epistemology, value theory and ontology.  Readings will be drawn primarily from the writings of contemporary scholars.This seminar is intended for philosophy majors who have had at least two philosophy courses.

It is also one of the best introductions into Hegel’s thinking as a whole. The Philosophy of Right begins with reflections on the concepts of freedom and the human person and proceeds from there, in a second part, to a discussion of morality, and then, in part 3, to a detailed examination of the family, civil society, and finally the state. Throughout the work, Hegel’s view is developmental and historical. The text ends therefore appropriately with a politically oriented view at “world history.”
The goal of the seminar is a careful reading of crucial sections of Hegel’s text. It will be preceded by a discussion of two related texts: Kant’s essay “Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View” and Hegel’s own “Reason in History” (the introduction to his Lectures on the Philosophy of History).
The seminar will conclude with a discussion of Karl Marx’s critical notes on the Philosophy of Right.Text: G.W.F. Hegel, Elements of the Philosophy of Right, translated by H.B.

The central aim of the course is to provide an opportunity for students to engage directly with philosophers, political theorists, and legal scholars working on normative questions. Another aim is to create a space that brings together people from different disciplines who have strong normative interests or who speak to issues philosophers and theorists should know something about.The format of the course will be as follows. For the first two hours of the course, a student will lead off with a 15-minute comment on the presenter’s paper and the presenter will have 5-10 minutes to respond before we open up the discussion to the entire assembled group. The first two hours will be open to non-enrolled students and faculty who wish to participate in the workshop discussion. At the end of the two hours, those who are not enrolled will leave, and for the third hour of the course, the guest presenter will continue the discussion with students enrolled in the course. Enrolled students must serve as a discussant for at least one presenter’s work-in-progress and write several short response papers and a final paper of 15-20 pages.The course is room-shared with the Law School and the Political Science Department. This course will follow the Law academic calendar. The first class meeting is August 26 and the final class meeting is December 2.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will examine fragments of thought and talk that seem to fail to be ‘fully factual’ in character.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPreviously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaWe will survey the basic questions of moral and political philosophy, as well as some classic attempts to answer them. We will ask, among other things: What is the morally right thing for me to do? Why should I do it? Is there a fact of the matter what it is, or does it just depend on my feelings or upbringing? Why should I do what the government tells me to? Why should I tolerate alien moral beliefs and practices? We may read, among others: Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes,  Locke,  Bentham,  Mill, and Nietzsche.Previously taught:

There are five sections in the course: Foundations (Dualism, Behaviorism and Central-State Materialism), Functionalism, Consciousness, Intentionality, and Personal Identity. What is the mind? Are mental states, such as beliefs and desires, memories and hopes, characteristics of a nonphysical substance, or are they configurations of the physical world? And if we think that mental states are entirely physical, should we think of them as relating to the ways in which a person tends to behave, or are they rather states of the person’s brain? Can a mental state be explained by its potential for causal relations with other mental states and with behavior? What is the relation between conscious experience and the brain? Is consciousness something over and above the ordinary biological functioning of the brain, or can it somehow be explained in biological terms? How can we explain our ability to think about the world? What is a person? These questions will be explored in the course of beginning to understand the nature of the mind.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will introduce the students to the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion ‘follows’ from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicates the intuitive notion of ‘follow’ in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if… then…’) and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as ‘for all…’ and ‘there exists…’). In addition, we will also develop techniques for showing when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and ‘interpretations’ for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus.

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaIn this course we will study the philosophical views of the most important and influential thinkers in early modern philosophy (roughly, the 17th and 18th centuries). This period in western thought was nothing short of extraordinary in that it saw the overthrow of a philosophical and scientific worldview that had dominated the west for over one thousand years. Prior to the 17th century, philosophy had been a blend of church doctrine and classical philosophy, and its methodology had been quite narrowly defined. The unfortunate effect of both the church’s influence on scholarly endeavors and the strictly defined methodology was that philosophical and scientific creativity was largely stifled. By the 17th century, however, the medieval worldview was beginning to crumble due in large part to a variety of subversive scientific discoveries. Advances in physics, astronomy and chemistry undermined central assumptions of classical science, which resulted in the wholesale abandonment of medieval philosophy more generally. Thus the scientific revolution of the 17th century set off an explosion of inspiration and creativity in the world of philosophy. It forced thinkers to make a new start in answering fundamental questions about the world such as: What is the nature of mind? What are the limits of human knowledge? What is a person? What is the basic stuff in the world?
These thinkers were the radicals of their day, and their views have shaped the way we practice contemporary philosophy. In fact, many of the philosophical questions we ask today could not have been formulated before these thinkers began to challenge philosophical orthodoxy. For that reason, studying the moderns is of central importance for understanding contemporary philosophy, and for understanding the nature of philosophical revolutions more generally.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is restricted to Philosophy majors. It is intended to improve the student’s ability to read and write philosophy. Special emphasis will be placed on developing analytic skills. There will be short written assignments each week, as well as a longer final paper, which will focus on the essays we are reading. In addition to two hours of lecture, students will meet in tutorials with a teaching assistant in order to discuss the reading, their weekly writing assignment, and the preparation for the final paper. This term, the readings will focus on problems related to free will.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe course will examine a range of psychological phenomena related to the ethical and spiritual life of humans, drawing on both contemporary philosophical approaches as well as non-western (primarily Confucian) perspectives on these phenomena. Topics to be covered include: pride, modesty and humility; anger, resentment and forgiveness; compassion, empathy and sympathy; death, grief and acceptance; purity, detachment and tranquility; ethical self-cultivation and ethical self-indulgence. The unifying theme underlying the exploration of these topics is the idea of ‘no self’, that is, the idea that ethical self-transformation involves a move away from different forms of undue focus on the self.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course will explore topics in the philosophy of art. What is art? What makes art valuable? Is art really valuable? What is a picture? Why are some pictures works of art, but not others? What is performance? What makes performance art? What does art reveal about human nature? What does art tell us about the mind? We will seek to answer these and other questions. We will read writings on these and related topics by a range of philosophers (mostly from the 20th century). Many of the readings for this course will come from an anthology entitled Aesthetics: A Comprehensive Anthology, published by Blackwells and edited by Cahn et al.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe single most important question in philosophy and in intellectual life generally at the present time is this: How, if at all, can we reconcile a certain conception that we have of ourselves as conscious, free, rational, ethical, language using, social and political human beings in a world consisting entirely of mindless, meaningless physical particles? This course is directed to the most essential part of that question, the nature of the human mind. What is consciousness and how can it be caused by brain processes? How does it function causally in our behavior? How do we represent reality to ourselves in our mental processes? What is the nature of perception, memory, knowledge and action? Do we have free will? Does the existence of unconscious mental processes threaten our free will? Can cognitive science extend our understanding of ourselves as human beings? Are our brains really just digital computers? How exactly do our mental processes underlie society and our construction of social institutions, such as money, property, marriage and governments? What is the nature of perception? This course will be concerned with these and other such fundamental questions in the foundations of philosophy, cognitive science and psychology.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis course is an in-depth introduction to the philosophy of Aristotle. We will study selections from each of his major works. Since Aristotle was an remarkably wide-ranging philosopher, this means that we will cover a wide variety of philosophical topics. The course divides into four units: (1) The Organon; (2) The Philosophy of Nature; (3) Metaphysics; (4) Ethics and Political Philosophy.    Prerequisites: Philos 25A or an equivalent lower-level course in ancient Greek philosophy.Required text: Aristotle: Selections, trans. Terence Irwin and Gail Fine (Hackett, 1995).Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe  Department of Philosophy at Berkeley seeks graduate students whose
talents and interests will enable them to benefit from the distinctive
intellectual resources on offer here, and who will contribute to
a stimulating and friendly philosophical community. The Department
values a diversity of interests, perspectives, and backgrounds among
its students.Admission to the Ph.D. program in Philosophy at Berkeley is highly
competitive. We typically receive hundreds of applications each year,
and can offer admission only to a small handful of students (the entering
class generally numbers fewer than ten). Students are admitted only for
the Ph.D. degree; there is no M.A. program in philosophy at Berkeley. All
students who are admitted must begin their study at Berkeley in the Fall
semester. Applications from women and members of underrepresented groups
are strongly encouraged.In reviewing applications, the Admissions and Fellowships Committee
looks for evidence that applicants have the training and intellectual
characteristics they will need for success in a rigorous graduate program
such as ours. Candidates for admission are not required to have majored
in philosophy, but applicants who have not taken a considerable number
of courses in the subject are unlikely to be admitted. The intellectual
characteristics that the Committee looks for include the ability to
write clear and well organized argumentative prose, the ability to
discriminate between promising and unpromising lines of inquiry, the
capacity to develop independent arguments and insights, and a nuanced
appreciation of philosophical problems and issues.The Admissions and Fellowships Committee attempts in each case
to arrive at a fair assessment of the candidate on the basis of the
totality of evidence submitted for review. It pays particularly close
attention to the candidate's sample of written work, as well as to the
letters of recommendation that are sent in support of the candidate's
application. Candidates should seek letters of recommendation from
teachers who are in a position to comment in detail both on their
general scholarly abilities and on their distinctively philosophical
talents and achievements. These same qualities should be evident in
the writing sample submitted for review; it should go beyond mere
exposition or superficial analysis of a philosophical text or problem.
A good target length for a writing sample is 15-20 (double-spaced) pages.Detailed information about admission to
graduate study at UC Berkeley is available on the
UCB Graduate Admissions
website of the UC Berkeley Graduate Division. The Berkeley
campus as a whole is home to a richly diverse intellectual community;
for more information see the Graduate Diversity Outreach site.To apply for admission to the Ph.D. program in
philosophy, apply online through the campus-wide
UCB Graduate Admissions
site.  Do not send materials to the Department of Philosophy.A complete online application would contain the following:For information on application deadlines
and other important dates please see the
UCB Graduate Admissions site.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis program is offered jointly by the Departments of Philosophy and Classics. It is administered
by an interdepartmental committee whose members areThe program is designed to produce scholars with a broad range of expertise
both in philosophy and classics, with the intention of bridging the gap between
the two subjects. It provides the training and specialist knowledge required
for undertaking research in ancient philosophy, and at the same time equips
students for scholarly work and teaching in either classics or philosophy.
Those who complete the program will be fully qualified to work as a member of
either one of these disciplines, while having developed a broad competence in
the other.Students apply for admission to either of the participating
departments in accordance with their qualifications and interests. They are
treated accordingly as graduate students fully in either the Department of
Classics or the Department of Philosophy. The program offers graduate students
in Classics the opportunity to take classes in philosophy as an integral part
of their work. And it offers graduate students in Philosophy the opportunity to
develop their knowledge of both classical languages, and to make a thorough
study of Graeco-Roman culture.  Students and faculty from the two departments
meet each other frequently and regularly in seminars, reading groups and
colloquia. Seminar offerings from the two departments are designed to give
students, during their years in the program, the opportunity to study a wide
variety of topics, including the Presocratics, Plato, Aristotle, Hellenistic
philosophy and the philosophy of later antiquity.Those entering the program as Philosophy students will take the broad range
of philosophy courses and seminars standardly required for the Ph.D. in
Philosophy. This standard set of requirements is, however, modified in the
following ways:To enter the joint program as a graduate student in Philosophy, prospective
graduates should apply to the Ph.D.  program in Philosophy and mention their
interest in the joint program as part of their statement of purpose. For
information about entering the joint program as a graduate student in Classics,
please visit the Department of Classics website.The Working Group in Ancient Philosophy,
 which is jointly sponsored by the Philosophy Department, the Classics
Department, and the
Doreen B. Townsend Center for the Humanities,
hosts many talks in ancient philosophy each year.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaEntering graduate students to the Department of Philosophy have
recently been offered up to six years of support. Typical packages
have included one to two years of full support from some fellowship
source, and three to four years of support as a Graduate Student
Instructor. (Students who require support beyond the sixth year are
generally offered the opportunity to teach for up to two additional
years as a Graduate Student Instructor.) Some students also receive
support in the form of readerships and research assistantships. Other
fellowships are available on a competitive basis from the university or
outside funding sources. The application for graduate study contains information about expenses
and about the many forms of financial support provided by the university,
as well as the forms that need to be completed to apply for fellowship
assistance. Further detailed information about the forms of support
available and the application procedures is available on the Graduate
Division's
Graduate Admissions
website. Applicants are also encouraged to apply for any support from outside
this university for which they might be eligible. The Philosophy Department draws upon University funding and upon its
own endowed funds in order to provide fellowship support for new and
continuing students. Each year the Philosophy Department nominates
several entering and continuing students for fellowships awarded through
University-wide competition. Fellowhip support is offered for up to
two years. In addition, those students who complete the qualifying
examination within the time prescribed for our program are eligible
for a third year of fellowship support in the form of a "Dean's
Normative Time Fellowship." The Department can offer most graduate students positions as Graduate
Student Instructors each semester and some positions are available
during the summer sessions. GSI positions are however restricted to
those who have completed at least one year of graduate study. The
appointment involves assisting in undergraduate courses, conducting
sections, grading papers, etc. Teaching for two semesters is required
for the Ph.D.  The salary covers the full costs of California resident
tuition and normal living expenses for the year.Individual faculty members may apply to the university for graduate
research assistantships in the areas of their own work. There are usually
several of these positions in the Department at any one time. The Department employs graduate students as readers and graders in
some undergraduate courses, paid at an hourly rate. This can provide a
supplement to a student's financial resources; actual earnings depend
on the size of the class and the amount of work assigned. The Department is often able to offset the higher tuition charged for
students who cannot qualify as California residents. Students are
however expected to establish residency during their first year of
graduate study.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis concentration is offered jointly by the Departments of
History and
Philosophy. It is administered by an interdepartmental committee whose
members are Paolo Mancosu, Department of Philosophy, Cathryn Carson,
Department of History, and Massimo Mazzotti, Department of History. The concentration provides the specialist training required for undertaking
research in the history of science or in the philosophy of science. At
the same time, it complements this training with first-hand knowledge
of the methods and concerns of the other discipline. Students apply for admission to one of the participating departments
in accordance with their qualifications and interests. These may include
a double major or an exposure to science in previous studies. Students
in the concentration are treated fully as graduate students  in either the
Department of History or the Department of Philosophy and will be fully
qualified to work and teach either in history or in philosophy. Students participating in the concentration as graduates in either
department are encouraged from the beginning to take advantage of
courses, seminars and other opportunities provided by the other
department. Both groups of students will meet each other regularly
in seminars and in reading groups, and are expected to attend
the two departments' respective history and philosophy of science
colloquia sponsored by the
Office for the History of Science and Technology
and in the
Working Group in the History and Philosophy of Logic, Mathematics and Science.Those entering the concentration as Philosophy students will take the
broad range of philosophy courses and seminars and the qualifying exam
standardly required for the PhD in Philosophy. This standard set of
requirements is, however, modified in the following ways for students in the
HPS concentration. To enter the concentration as a graduate student in Philosophy, prospective
graduates should apply to the Ph.D. program in Philosophy and mention
their interest in the HPS concentration as part of their statement of
purpose. For information on entering the concentration as a graduate student in
History, please see the
Department of History's website.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThere are three different graduate programs at the University
of California, Berkeley, in which a student wishing to specialize
in logic and related fields may enroll:

The Ph.D. Program in Philosophy.
Students who
choose to specialize in logic within the context of this program are
expected to obtain a broad education in philosophy.The Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science
administers a program leading to the degree of
Ph.D. in Logic and the Methodology of Science. The Group is not a part
of the Department of Mathematics or of the Department of Philosophy;
rather, it is an independent program staffed by faculty members from
Mathematics and Philosophy, along with several from Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science.  Students who want to pursue the Ph.D. in Logic and
the Methodology of Science should apply directly to the Graduate Program
in Logic and the Methodology of Science, rather than to Mathematics or
Philosophy. Students in the L&M program are expected to study both mathematics
and philosophy, though they need not meet all the breadth
requirements for a Ph.D. in either field.  They must pass one examination
in the foundations of mathematics, one examination in philosophy (Area I),
and a third in either mathematics or philosophy. Although there are no
graduate instructorships in Logic and Methodology of Science, students
in this program may, if qualified, hold graduate student instructorships
in the Department of Mathematics or in the Department of Philosophy. The Department of Mathematics
administers a program leading to a Ph.D. in Mathematics. Students in this
program may specialize in the foundations of mathematics, but are also
expected to study other aspects of mathematics. In particular, they must
pass departmental qualifying examinations in two other areas as well as
in the foundations of mathematics. The Department of Mathematics also
has a program leading to an M.A. degree.The Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science sponsors a biweekly
logic colloquium,
with talks by mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers.The Working Group in the History and Philosophy
of Logic, Mathematics, and Science,
jointly sponsored by the Philosophy Department and the
Doreen B. Townsend Center for the Humanities,
sponsors monthly talks, many of them on topics connected to logic.
The Berkeley-Stanford Circle in Logic and Philosophy brings
  together graduate students from UC Berkeley and Stanford University
  to discuss research at the intersection of Logic and Philosophy.
Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe graduate program in philosophy at Berkeley offers a
first-rate faculty, a stimulating and friendly community of
graduate students, and the resources of one of the world's finest
research universities.Two features distinguish our profile from that of other leading
graduate programs in philosophy:The department has strengths in all the main areas of
philosophy, including epistemology, philosophy of mind,
metaphysics, philosophy of language, logic, ethics, the history of
philosophy, and philosophy of science. We aim at diversity and
breadth of coverage, rather than concentration on one or two areas
of philosophical activity.Second, the program at Berkeley is structured to give students
a high degree of independence in tailoring their studies to their
interests.Those wishing to pursue graduate studies in philosophy can
choose among several routes to a Ph.D. at Berkeley:The Philosophy Department's graduate program leads to a
Ph.D. in Philosophy.Students with strong interests in
Ancient Philosophy
may want to take
advantage of a special "ancient concentration" within the philosophy
program.Students with strong interests in the
History and Philosophy of Science may want to
explore the special "HPS concentration" within the philosophy program.Students with strong interests in
formal logic may pursue them
in the Philosophy Department, in the Mathematics Department, or
in Berkeley's interdisciplinary program leading to a Ph.D. in
Logic and the Methodology of Science,
to which the Philosophy Department has close ties.The Berkeley
job placement
effort has been highly successful; graduates of our program have
gone on to academic positions in a wide variety of colleges and
universities in the U.S. and abroad.The Berkeley campus is home to a richly diverse intellectual
community; more information is available on the
Graduate Diversity Outreach
site. The Department of Philosophy has a vibrant graduate student community
and offers many opportunities for graduate students to collaborate and
socialize, from informal reading groups to formal workshops
and conferences.  At the weekly meetings of the Richard Wollheim Society,
graduate students present papers and get feedback from their
peers.  Students who have passed their qualifying examinations are
encouraged to participate in a special seminar that meets weekly
to discuss dissertation work in progress.  Many graduate students in
the department participate in interdisciplinary working groups sponsored by the
Townsend Center for the Humanities,
including the Working Groups in
Ancient Philosophy,
Philosophy of Mind,
and History and Philosophy of Logic,
Mathematics and Science.
And each spring, the philosophy departments at UC Berkeley, Stanford,
and UC Davis co-sponsor a graduate student conference at which students
from all three departments as well as other philosophy departments
around California present and discuss papers on a wide variety of
philosophical topics. In addition, the department co-sponsors an annual graduate student
conference with the University of London, with the location alternating
between Berkeley and London.  When the conference is in London,
Berkeley sends six students there (three as presenters, three as
commentators); when the conference is in Berkeley, the situation
is reversed.  A faculty member from the visiting institution
presents a keynote address.  There are also possibilities for
Berkeley graduate students to spend a semester in London
during their graduate careers at Berkeley.For more information on resources for
graduate students at Berkeley, see the Graduate Division website. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaApproved by Graduate Council and Graduate Division, Nov. 10, 2008.
These requirements apply prospectively beginning with those admitted for 
Fall 2009. Students who entered the program under the old requirements
may choose either to continue under that regime or to adopt the requirements below.The Ph.D. program is designed to provide students with a broad
knowledge of the field of philosophy, while giving them opportunities to
work intensively on the issues that interest them the most.  During the
first stage of their graduate education, students meet the Department's
course distribution requirements and prepare to take the qualifying
examination. This examination assesses the student's strengths in areas chosen by the
student in consultation with supervising faculty. After passing the exam,
students advance to candidacy and begin writing the Ph.D. thesis. A
detailed explanation of the requirements for the Ph.D. in Philosophy
follows.During the first stage of the program, students are expected to
acquire a broad background in philosophy and develop their philosophical
abilities by fulfilling the following requirements: A one-semester seminar for
first-year graduate students only, conducted by two faculty members,
on some central area of philosophy. The Logic Requirement has two components:Both parts of the requirement may be fulfilled by
successful completion of equivalent
logic courses before arriving at Berkeley. Whether taken at Berkeley or
elsewhere, courses taken in fulfillment of the logic requirement do not
count towards the eight-course distribution requirement.Before taking the Qualifying Exam the student must complete eight courses at
the 100- or 200-level completed with a grade of A- or higher. At least four of
the eight courses must be graduate seminars. The eight courses must satisfy the
following distribution requirements:Two of the eight courses must be in the history of philosophy: one in ancient
philosophy and one in modern philosophy. The courses may be on any individual
philosopher or group of philosophers drawn from the following lists:Four of the eight courses must be in the following areas, with at least one
course from each area:A seventh course may be any Philosophy course in the 100 or 200 series
except for 100, 195-199, 200, 250, 251 and 299.An eighth course may be either any Philosophy course as specified
above or a course from another Department which has been approved by
the Graduate Advisor.In exceptional cases, students may, at the discretion of the Graduate
Advisor, meet one distribution requirement by presenting work done as
a graduate student elsewhere: typically a graduate thesis or work done in
a graduate-level course. Meeting a distribution requirement in this way
will not count as meeting any part of the four-seminar requirement.Before taking the Qualifying Examination the candidate must pass a
departmental examination in French, German, Greek, or Latin requiring the
translation of 600 words in two hours with the use of a dictionary. An
examination in another language may be approved by the Graduate Advisor if it
contains significant philosophical literature related to the student's
dissertation work.Students should aim to take the qualifying examination by the end of the
fifth enrolled semester and they must take it by the end of the sixth enrolled
semester.In order to take the examination the student must have fulfilled the
department's course requirements and must have passed the language requirement.The qualifying examination is administered
by a committee of three faculty members from the department and one faculty
member of another department. The members of this committee are nominated to
the Graduate Division by the Graduate Advisor in consultation with
the candidate.Soon after assembling an examination committee, the candidate should, in
consultation with this committee, write a 300-word description and compile a
list of readings for each of three proposed topics for examination. Each topic
should be centered on a major philosophical problem or question. Together the
topics should reflect a balance of breadth and depth, and the
Graduate Advisor must approve that they meet these criteria.A week before the qualifying examination, the candidate should submit an
overview essay of 1500-3000 words for each topic, which expands on the initial
description. The essay should aim to lay out the central problem or question,
to explain its importance, and to evaluate critically the attempts to resolve
or answer it, with an eye to forming a view within, or about, the debate.The qualifying examination itself will be a three-hour oral
exam administered by the committee. The candidate's essays are meant to serve as
a springboard for discussion in the exam. The purpose of the examination is to
test the student's general mastery of philosophy. Students are expected to
draw on the information, skills and understanding acquired in their graduate
study and to demonstrate sufficient breadth and depth of philosophical
comprehension and ability to provide a basis for proceeding toward a Ph.D.If a student fails the qualifying examination, the examining committee may
or may not recommend that a second examination be administered by the same
committee. The second examination must be administered no sooner than three
months and no later than six months following the first attempt. Failure on the
second attempt will result in the student being automatically dismissed
from the graduate program. (See
Section F2.7 of the Guide to Graduate Policy.)Students should advance to candidacy as soon as possible and they must do
so no later than a year after passing the qualifying examination or
the end of their sixth semester in the program, whichever comes first,
to maintain satisfactory progress in the program. (An exception to the
above policy will be made for those students who, having failed the
qualifying exam in their sixth semester, may be granted the possibility
to take it a second time in their seventh semester. In the case of a
successful retake, the student must advance to candidacy by the end of the
seventh semester.)Before advancement to candidacy the student must constitute a dissertation
committee consisting of two faculty members from the department and an outside
faculty member from another department.In the semester after passing the qualifying examination the student must
take two individual study courses of 4 units each with the two inside members
of his or her dissertation committee for the purpose of preparing a
dissertation prospectus.The dissertation prospectus should be submitted both to the inside members
of the committee and to the Graduate Advisor by the end of that semester. It
should consist of about fifteen pages and outline plans for the dissertation.
Alternatively, the prospectus may consist of parts of a possible chapter of the
dissertation together with a short sketch of the dissertation project.Following submission of the prospectus, the candidate will meet with the
inside members of the committee for an informal discussion of the candidate's
proposed research.The Doctoral Completion Fellowship (DCF) is a one-year fellowship
available to graduate students who have advanced to candidacy and
meet several additional conditions.  Students are advised to review the
eligibility requirements for the DCF.Each student for the Ph.D. degree is expected to serve as a graduate student
instructor for at least two semesters.Students in the first two years after declaring candidacy
must register for the dissertation seminar (Philosophy 295) for at least one
semester each year, during which they must present a piece of work in progress,
and are expected to attend the seminar all year.  (The seminar meets every
other week.)  All students working on dissertations are encouraged
to attend the seminar.At the end of each academic year, there will be a meeting of the
student and both co-chairs of his or her dissertation committee to discuss the
student’s progress over the year and his or her plans for the following
year.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaPre-2009 Graduate Program Requirements. The requirements below apply by default to students who were admitted prior to Fall 2009. The current requirements are available here.
The Ph.D. program is designed to provide students with a broad
knowledge of the field of philosophy, while giving them opportunities to
work intensively on the issues that interest them the most.   During the
first stage of their graduate education, students meet the Department's
course distribution requirements and prepare to take the qualifying
exam. This exam assesses the student's strengths in areas chosen by the
student in consultation with supervising faculty. After passing the exam,
students advance to candidacy and begin writing the Ph.D. thesis. A
detailed explanation of the requirements for the Ph.D. in Philosophy
follows.During the first stage of the program, students are expected to
acquire a broad background in philosophy and  develop their philosophical
abilities by fulfilling the following  requirements: First Year Seminar A one-semester seminar for
first-year graduate students only, conducted by two faculty members,
on some central area of philosophy. Logic Requirement Completion of Philosophy
12A: Introduction to Logic or its equivalent, with a grade of B+
or better. This requirement may be fulfilled in one of three ways:
successful completion of an equivalent logic course taken before
arriving at Berkeley, successful completion of Phil 12A or an equivalent
course at UC Berkeley, or by passing a logic exam administered by the
Department. Course Distribution Requirement Before passing
the Qualifying Exam the student must pass eight courses at the 100-or
200-level completed with a grade of A- or better. At least four of the
eight courses must be graduate seminars. Otherwise, in order to insure
breadth in their graduate studies in philosophy students must take
courses fulfilling the following distribution requirements:Two of the eight courses must be history courses, one in ancient
philosophy and one in modern philosophy. The courses may be on individual
philosophers or on groups of philosophers from the following list:
Four courses must be taken in the following areas, with at least one
from each:
A seventh course may be any Philosophy course in the 100 or 200 series
except for 100, 195-199, 200, 250, 251 and 299.An eighth course may be either any Philosophy course as specified
above or a course from another Department which has been approved by
the Graduate Advisor.In exceptional cases, students may, at the discretion of the Graduate
Advisor, meet one distribution requirement by presenting work done as
a graduate student elsewhere: either a graduate thesis or work done in
a graduate-level course. Meeting a distribution requirement in this way
will not count as meeting any part of the four-seminar requirement.Language Requirement Before taking the
Qualifying Exam students must fulfill part or all of the language
requirement. See below for a description of the requirement. The Qualifying Examination 
Students choose two fields from two different areas—either two
major fields, or one major field and one minor field. Two topics are
chosen from a major field, and one topic is chosen from the other
field. The three topics are the main topics of the examination. With
the help of three supervising faculty members, the student will write
a brief description of the topics on which the student has chosen to be
examined, as well as a list of readings. The supervising faculty will be
especially concerned with the balance of breadth and depth in approving
the student's proposal. The examination is a three-hour oral examination conducted by
four faculty members, one of whom is from outside the Philosophy
Department. Its purpose is to test students' general mastery of the
field of philosophy. Students are expected to draw on the information,
skills and understanding acquired during their first two years of graduate
study and to demonstrate sufficient breadth and depth of philosophical
comprehension and ability to proceed to the Ph.D. The examination may
be taken only after the student has passed one language examination and
completed all the course requirements. Students should aim to take the
examination by the end of the fourth semester, and they must pass it by
the end of the sixth semester.Major

passing the Ph.D. Qualifying Exam, may advance to candidacy and begin
writing their doctoral dissertation. Dissertation work is done under the
supervision of a committee of two faculty members from the Department
of Philosophy and one faculty member from another department. Language Requirement
Following university policy the Department of Philosophy requires its
graduate students be proficient in one or two (depending on the method of
fulfillment) foreign languages, typically French or German. The language
requirement may be fulfilled in one of three ways:  (a) The student passes departmental examinations in each of two
foreign languages, one of which is either French or German; an examination
in a second language other than French or German may be approved by the
Graduate Advisors if it contains significant philosophical literature
related to the student's work. These examinations involve translating
(into English) a passage of about 300 words in one and one-half hours
with a dictionary. One of these examinations must be passed before taking
the Qualifying Examination. The second must be passed within 18 months
of advancement to candidacy. (b) Before taking the Qualifying Examination, the student passes a
departmental examination in either French or German in which a passage
of about 1000 words is translated into English in three hours without
a dictionary. (c) The student passes an examination in French or German of the sort
described in paragraph (a) before the Qualifying Examination, and after
the Qualifying Examination passes an examination in the same language,
of the sort described in paragraph (b). Teaching
Each student for the Ph.D. degree is expected to serve as a graduate student instructor for at least two semesters. Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe Philosophy Department offers comprehensive guidance and support to
its Ph.D. students when they seek academic employment. The Department's
placement advisor holds informational meetings for job candidates,
offers detailed advice about their application materials, and oversees
the assembly of their dossiers. The Department also schedules practice
interviews for new job candidates, as well as a “Graduate Research
Colloquium” at which they each present results of their research to the
entire Department; these events replicate, as far as possible, a
regular philosophy talk, providing valuable feedback for candidates as
they prepare for on-campus interviews. The Department
provides placement support to its Ph.D. students until such time as
they receive an offer of continuing academic employment (a
tenure-track position or equivalent).Placements for Ph.D. recipients since 1997 (including students
from the Group in Logic and Methodology of Science who have
specialized in philosophy) are listed below.  Offers tendered
but not accepted are shown in gray.  Offers are tenure-track

      Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaFirst, read the Frequently Asked Questions below. If that doesn’t help, here are some other resources:For help with declaring the major, registering for classes, checking progress to the degree, and getting put on the degree list, see Janet Groome, the Undergraduate Student Affairs Officer, in 314 Moses.For help with transfer courses, study abroad, advice on courses, and other questions, contact Professor Niko Kolodny, the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor, using this address: kolodny@berkeley.edu.You do need to be a philosophy major to enroll in Philosophy 100. Other upper-division courses are available to non-majors (provided that they have met any specific prerequisites for the course). However, non-majors are usually blocked from enrolling in upper-division courses until Phase II.Unfortunately, this is difficult to predict. If there is a long wait list for a course, we try to increase the enrollment limit. But we cannot always do this; it depends on whether we have the available staff and classroom space. Ask the instructor for advice on the first day of class (or earlier if it’s an emergency). Some instructors take special factors into consideration in determining who comes in off the wait list.You should have taken at least one philosophy course.  Beyond that, there are no specific requirements.  What matters is that you have taken enough philosophy to feel confident that philosophy is right for you.  Some people might be hooked after only one or two courses.  Others might need to take more to be sure.  It’s up to you.If you are a transfer student, it’s fine if you have taken enough philosophy at your prior school to know that it’s what you want to pursue here.  You needn’t have taken any philosophy courses at Berkeley to declare the major.  If you are still unsure whether to major in philosophy, but think that there is a good chance that you may, consider taking courses that will satisfy major requirements.  That way, if you do major in philosophy, you’ll already have some requirements completed.Go to 314 Moses Hall (Philosophy Department office).  Fill out a Declaration of Major form.  Submit to the Student Affairs Officer in 314 Moses.Forms are available in 314 Moses, but also online:https://ls.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/advmajordeclaration.pdfIf you are declaring philosophy as a second major, then you may need to take further steps.  For more information, see here:https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/schedule-planning/double-majors-and-simultaneous-degreesFirst,
work on fulfilling the requirements for the minor (see
Minor. Then at the start of your last semester at Berkeley, go to 206 Evans Hall and get a Declaration of Minor form. Take it to 314 Moses Hall and ask the Student Affairs Officer to verify that you have taken the required courses, or are in the process of taking them. The Student Affairs Officer will then file the form for you at the end of the semester after you have received your final grades.Yes.  For the minor, students must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.0 in all six required courses and also in all five required upper-division courses.For the major: Regulation 809.D of the Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate states:Candidates for the A.B. degree must attain at least a C (2.000) 
average overall in all of the courses required in the major 
program, at least a C average in the upper-division courses 
required in the major program, and at least a C average in the 
upper-division courses taken at Berkeley that are required in 
the major program; averages higher than a C may be required 
only for Honors Programs.Community college courses cannot satisfy upper-division requirements, but appropriate community college courses may satisfy the 12A, 25A, and 25B requirements.  Appropriate community college courses may also count as a lower-division elective.Check whether the course is “articulated” with 12A, 25A, 25B, or another lower-division course, by visiting www.assist.org or asking the Student Affairs Officer.If the course is articulated, inform the Student Affairs Officer, by email, with your SID, last name, first name in the subject field of the message. You are done!If the course is not articulated, then to see whether it can count as 12A, 25A, or 25B, skip to 4.  To see whether it can count as a lower-division elective skip to 6.Here are the MINIMUM conditions to satisfy the 12A, 25A, and 25B requirements. Please be advised that very few community college courses meet these conditions. While community college courses are often excellent, they are also usually meant for a general audience. In contrast, Phil 12A, 25A, and 25B are designed for intended majors, so they cover different ground.For 12A: Coverage of propositional logic, monadic predicate logic, and polyadic predicate logic, both syntactically (by means of derivation systems) and semantically (by means of interpretations or models). This is the material covered, for example, in Barwise and Etchemendy, Language, Proof, and Logic, Ch. 1–14.3. You will need to provide a problem set or exam in which you were asked to demonstrate semantically the invalidity of arguments using multiple quantifiers (e.g., to use a very basic example, showing that “There exists an x such that for all y, xRy,” does not follow from “For all x, there exists a y such that xRy”).For 25A: Focus mainly on Plato and Aristotle, with material on pre-Socratic philosophy as background and with mediaeval philosophy not included. Substantial coverage not only of ethics, but also of metaphysics and epistemology. In-depth examination of specific arguments with a great deal of attention to careful reading of primary texts with a view to understanding the arguments and the philosophical issues they raise. Substantial written assignments testing students’ grasp of specific points of argument raised by the texts as well as their capacity to think philosophically about the relevant issues.For 25B: Focus on careful reading of at least five of the following philosophers: Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hobbes, Locke, Hume and Kant. Focus mostly on epistemology and metaphysics. In-depth examination of specific arguments with a great deal of attention to careful reading of primary texts with a view to understanding the arguments and the philosophical issues raised by those arguments. Substantial written assignments testing students’ grasp of specific points of argument raised by the texts as well as their capacity to think philosophically about the relevant issues.If you believe the course you took at another school met the minimum conditions in 4. to count as 12A, 25A, or 25B, please email the Faculty Undergraduate Advisor, with the following: (i) your SID, last name, first name, in the subject heading, (ii) a copy of the syllabus, (iii) a detailed, written explanation, with reference to the syllabus, of how the course satisfied the minimum conditions, and (iv) any further documentation (e.g., textbook table of contents, exams, problem sets, paper topics) necessary to support the written explanation. The FUA will reply to let you know whether the course has been approved.Here are the MINIMUM conditions to count as a lower-division elective:It MUST be a philosophy course.Although it need not exactly match any philosophy course currently listed in the Berkeley Guide, it MUST be a course that our department would be willing to offer.  (This means that it cannot simply be, for example, a course on a particular mystical tradition, psychotherapeutic practice, or political movement.)It CANNOT be a logic/ critical thinking/ critical reasoning course.You CANNOT be using it to satisfy the 12A, 25A, or 25B requirement.It MUST have assigned original works by philosophers, NOT merely paraphrases or short excerpts (i.e., of no more than a few pages of continuous text). It MUST have required written essays of at least three pages in length.It MUST have been taken prior to enrolling at Berkeley.If you believe the course you took at community college meets the conditions in 6. to count as a lower-division elective, then email BOTH the Student Affairs Officer AND the Faculty Undergraduate Advisor with the following: (i) your SID, last name, first name, in the subject heading, and (ii) a copy of the syllabus.  The SAO will confirm that it has been received.  Unless you get a request from the FUA for further information or documentation, the course has been approved.Have you already counted a course in another department as one of your three required philosophy electives for the major? Or are you a minor?  Then stop! You may satisfy only one of the three philosophy electives required for the major, and none of the three philosophy electives required for the minor, with a course from another department.Otherwise, check the list of over a hundred approved courses, from all over the university, here. Any course that is cross-listed with an approved course on the list is automatically approved. So, if you don’t find the course that you want approved in one department, and it is cross-listed with courses in other departments, check those other departments. Here are some recently approved courses, which have not yet been put on the list:If the course you want to count has no asterisk, or if it is cross-listed with a course on the list that has no asterisk, just tell the Student Affairs Officer, by email, with your SID, last name, first name, in the subject heading. You are done!If the course you want to count is on the list, but has an asterisk, then email the Faculty Advisor, with the following: (i) your SID, last name, first name, in the subject heading, (ii) a syllabus, or at least a list of the assigned readings, for course. The Faculty Advisor will reply to let you know whether the course has been approved.If the course you want to count is not on the list, then please be advised that it is very unlikely that the course can count as an elective. If you still want to try, email the Faculty Advisor, with the following: (i) your SID, last name, first name, in the subject heading, (ii) a copy of the syllabus, (iii) a written explanation with reference to the syllabus, of how the content of the course that overlaps with, or at least is very closely connected with, the content of courses offered in the philosophy department, and (iv) any further documentation (e.g., textbook table of contents, problem sets, paper topics) necessary to support the written explanation. The Faculty Advisor will reply to let you know whether the course has been approved.Are you trying to satisfy 12A, 25A, or 25B?  Then see this FAQ: “How can I count a community college course toward the major?”.  Start at paragraph 4.Are you trying to satisfy an upper-division requirement?  If so, have you already satisfied three upper-division requirements for the major, or two for the minor, with courses from other schools? Then stop! You may satisfy at most three upper-division requirements for the major, and at most two for the minor, with work from elsewhere.Please email the Faculty Advisor, with the following: (i) your SID, last name, first name, in the subject heading, (ii) the major requirement for which you want the course to count (e.g., elective, ethics, etc.), (iii) a copy of, or links to, a syllabus and/or course description, and (iv) the number Berkeley semester units the course satisfies. A quarter course (e.g., any course taken at another UC campus) counts as only two-thirds of a semester course. So a single quarter course will not count at all, two quarter courses will count as only one semester course, and three quarter courses will count as two semester courses. The MyEAP course catalog gives unit information on EAP courses. For other courses, find out the total number of hours of instruction. The Faculty Advisor will reply to let you know whether the course has been approved.Visit L&S’s “Enrolling Elsewhere” page and make sure that you have satisfied the requirements there.You should take Phil. 100 as soon as possible after you declare your major. The purpose of Phil. 100 is to teach you how to do a better job of reading, writing, and thinking critically about philosophy. It gives you a lot of practice writing and a lot of individual attention. What you learn in 100 will probably help you get a lot more from your other upper-division courses.Yes; the course is closed to non-majors. That said, you can file your Declaration of Major during the first week of the semester in which you are taking Phil. 100. Strictly speaking, no. There are two ways to fulfill the Phil. 100
Requirement. You can either (1) Take and pass Phil. 100, or (2) Show that you
already have the relevant skills by presenting the evidence described in How
to Meet the Philosophy 100 Requirement. Roughly speaking, you need to get straight As in your first two philosophy courses at Berkeley. Option (2) requires (inter alia) filing a Petition Concerning the Philosophy 100 Requirement. Note that if you take option (2), then you only need to take 11 courses for the major.  However, we strongly advise planning on option (1). Very, very few students qualify for option (2). It’s a bit of a catch-22; it’s very hard to get As in your first two philosophy courses at Berkeley without the training you get in 100! Moreover, even when students do qualify for option (2), we still encourage them to take 100. (In that case, they only have to take 11 courses for the major, since they can count Philosophy 100 as an upper-division elective.)If you completed a major requirement in one of the following ways, then it may not show up in DARS.So long as you have followed the relevant instructions and, where the Faculty Advisor’s approval is necessary, been cc-ed on a course approval email from the Faculty Advisor to the Student Affairs Officer, there is no need to worry.  The Student Affairs Officer has a record that you have satisfied the requirement.  Yes. Courses you took via concurrent enrollment will apply towards the requirements of the major in just way that they would had you taken the course as a formally enrolled student at Berkeley. As long as your concurrent enrollment classes appear on your Berkeley transcript, you will be credited with fulfilling the relevant major requirements.Here are a some ideas:No, you do have to take it. If you have trouble with logic, it is essential to be very, very good about keeping up with problem sets. Learning logic is like learning a language or a musical instrument: a little each day is better than trying to cram all at once. You should also ask your GSI and your instructor for help. You might think about forming a study group. Peer tutoring may also be available. Taking 12A P/NP may also be an option. You may take one (but only one) of the twelve required courses for the major P/NP, including 12A. But please keep in mind that in order to get a P, you need at least a C minus for the course.Our tutoring program aims to help undergraduates develop the essential skills required for participating in rigorous philosophical discourse. To this end, we offer one-on-one appointments with a peer tutor to any undergraduate currently enrolled in a philosophy course. 
Appointments are 60 minutes. To get the most out of your appointment, it is in your interest to come with a clear sense of what you want to get out of it. Here are some things a tutor can help you with:Sign up here to make an appointment with a tutor.Yes, if you meet a couple of conditions. First, you should be a senior;
second, you should already know something about the subject-matter of the
seminar; third, you will need the instructor’s consent. Taking a graduate
seminar is one requirement for Honors in philosophy, but you do not have to be pursuing Honors to take a seminar.Absolutely not. Here are some ideas: Every member of the department has office hours, for starters. You should not hesitate to drop by for conversation with your instructors during their O.H.s. You (and they) will get the most out of this if you go in with a specific question about the course material.Most faculty members are also happy to make an appointment to see you outside of O.H.s. Try e-mailing for an appointment; 15 or 20 minutes would be a good time-block to ask for.You might also want to consider going to departmental colloquia. The talks are interesting, and many faculty members here participate in the discussion following the talks. This may suggest topics for conversation during the coffee break after the talk, or during the reception after the discussion.If you have room in your schedule, you may ask a faculty member if he or she would be willing to let you enroll for an independent study, Phil 199.You should propose a plan at the beginning of the semester.  The plan should include what you will read and write, and a schedule of meetings with the faculty member.  Per the general catalog, you will need to meet with the instructor for at least an hour per week per unit. That is, one unit of 199 means that you meet with the faculty member for one hour per week, two units means two hours per week, and so on. Phil 199 will not satisfy major requirements.  It is graded P/NP.No; in fact philosophy works very well as half of a double major. The trick, as with any double major, is in meeting a large number of requirements in a limited amount of time. Keep in mind that no more than two upper division courses may be used in common to fulfill requirements in both majors. So planning is essential. See here to get started: https://ls.berkeley.edu/node/244A couple of things. First, several semesters
before graduation, carefully check which major requirements you haven’t yet
met, and make sure you will be able to meet them in time. If there are
potential problems, go talk to one of the undergraduate advisors (see top of
page). Second, be sure you put yourself on the degree list at the beginning of
your last semester. Here’s how. When you enroll in classes online or via
Telebears, the system will ask whether you want to put yourself on the degree
list. Say yes. If it’s too late to do it that way, you need to do it through
L&S. Third, if you would like to take part in the department’s graduation ceremony, watch the bulletin boards next to 301 Moses for information. The ceremony takes place in May; you are welcome to participate if you were graduated the previous winter or if you have a few more requirements to meet in summer session.A big study conducted ten years ago showed that philosophy majors outscore all other humanities majors on the LSATs, GREs, and GMATs. On the LSATs, only majors in Economics and Mathematics did better. It’s hard to know how much the advantage lies in qualities that make students lean toward philosophy, and how much the coursework in philosophy gives majors their edge.You can try studying on your own, but it’s not easy. Your best bet is to apply to an M.A. program or a Ph.D. program. Most programs admit students for fall entry, and most application deadlines are in the previous winter. You will therefore need figure out where to apply and get your application materials together almost one full year before you plan actually to start your advanced degree program.UC Berkeley has programs designed to help undergraduates prepare for graduate
studies during their undergraduate career. You may want to take a look at the
STEP by Step web site for tips on what
to do when to prepare yourself. The Graduate Diversity
Outreach program may also be able to help advise you.Talk with a faculty member who knows you or who shares your philosophical interests. You might also want to talk with a faculty advisor.Whether
you’re applying to professional school or graduate school, you will need
letters of recommendation from philosophy department faculty members. Some
students assume that if you don’t know the professor personally, you should
not ask him or her for a letter. False! All faculty members who have had you
in their classes will be happy to talk with you about writing a letter for
you, whether they already know you or not. The best way to approach them is to
go in during office hours or e-mail a request for an appointment. Bring with
you the following: the written work you did for their courses; a copy of your
transcript (unofficial is OK); a resumé, c.v., or statement of purpose, if you
have one; a list of the places you’re applying to; and a letter form from the
Career Service. This means that you will need to go ahead of time to the Career Service office (2111 Bancroft Way) to sign up for their letter service.As the website reads: “The Honors Program is for undergraduate majors who want to work more intensively and independently on a subject that they have studied in the course of their undergraduate studies.” In other words, the main reason is that you are so interested in a particular topic that you want to devote a year focusing on it, above and beyond the necessary coursework for the major. That’s a wonderful reason — just be sure that it is actually your reason!No. For one thing, many students are admitted to graduate school by March of their senior year, before they have completed coursework for a honors program. For another, some undergraduate colleges don’t have any special honors program, and yet their students are regularly admitted to graduate school. The Berkeley graduate program often accepts students who were not involved in any honors program.What matters most in graduate admissions are, first, high grades in a wide range of challenging philosophy courses; second, strong letters of recommendation from your instructors; and, third, a compelling writing sample. In addition, having “honors” on your transcript can’t hurt. But how much it helps is less clear. Keep in mind that time spent pursuing honors may be time that you could devote to doing better in your regular coursework. If the decision is either pursuing honors, or ensuring that you do better in your courses, there’s a strong argument that the latter will be in the end more important for graduate school.Unfortunately, not. Here’s an example from the 2010-11 academic year. Of the six people who started the honors program in fall, only three actually completed the required work (i.e. graduate seminar and thesis). Of the three who completed the required work, only two were actually awarded honors. So, of the six who started, only two were awarded honors. The students who did not complete honors were nonetheless exceptional students, several with GPAs of 3.9. Here’s another example, from the 2011-12 academic year.  Of the four people who started the honors program in fall, all four completed the required work. However, only one of the four was actually awarded honors. It is very easy to underestimate how much time it will take.The honors program is a huge time commitment. Students almost always underestimate how much time it will take. Recall that the honors program has two components. First, you have to take a graduate seminar. While this graduate seminar counts toward your 12 required courses for the major, it is more demanding than an undergraduate course. It typically requires a 15-20-page term paper. Second, you need to research and write an independent 35-45-page thesis by mid-April. This is at least as much work as two four-unit semester courses. However, none of the work on the thesis counts toward your 12 required courses for the major. It is over and above your usual coursework.We don’t mean to be discouraging! Indeed, we’re delighted that you’re interested in spending extra time doing philosophy! But before students decide to embark on honors, they need to understand what it involves, and they need to be clear about what they hope to get out of it.Yes. The Cal Philosophy Forum sponsors discussions of philosophical topics and produces an undergraduate philosophy journal, Harvest Moon. For more information, see their Facebook page.There are many opportunities of this kind.  The single best resource is: http://research.berkeley.edu/.  Look under “Opportunities” for a list of the possibilities.

This is a list of courses that are approved as outside electives for the purposes of the Philosophy major.  Courses marked with an asterisk (*) may or may not qualify, depending on the contact: please contact the Undergraduate Advisor with a syllabus. Note that at most one outside elective can be used to satisfy major requirements. For more details, see “How do I count a course in another department as a philosophy elective?” in the FAQs.* Contact the Undergraduate Advisor with a syllabus to make sure the current version qualifies.* Contact the Undergraduate Advisor with a syllabus to make sure the current version qualifies.* Contact the Undergraduate Advisor with a syllabus to make sure the current version qualifies.Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThe Philosophy Department offers a  major and minor in
philosophy, as well as a minor in logic.
Qualified majors in philosophy have the further option of
entering the  honors program. Details on the requirements for a
major in philosophy,
minor in philosophy,
minor in logic,
and honors in philosophy follow. The course requirements for completing a major in philosophy
are structured to ensure that student gets a broad education in
philosophy. At least twelve (12) courses must be completed in total,
fulfilling the distribution requirements detailed in the table below. For
more information about the undergraduate major in philosophy, including
advising sources within the Department and UC Berkeley, see the 
Frequently Asked Questions page.We recommend that majors and prospective majors consult
the statement of learning goals
that has been developed in connection with the
Undergraduate
Student Learning Initiative.[PDF checklist of major requirements]The Honors Program is for undergraduate majors who want to work more intensively and independently on a subject that they have studied in the course of their undergraduate studies.Interested students should seek admission to the Honors Program a year before their expected graduation (typically, the end of spring of their junior year).  Admission into the Honors Program requires:The requirements of the honors program are:
Students admitted to the Honors Program should begin work on the thesis as
soon as they are admitted to honors. So, typically, they should start their
research over summer before senior year.  Note that H195
does not count toward the twelve required for the major.  However,
H196, 190, and 290 do count toward the required twelve, as
upper-division electives.Completing the honors program requirements is necessary but not sufficient
for receiving departmental honors. Honors are awarded by the department faculty
based on the quality of the senior thesis and the student's overall record.
See the FAQs for answers to further
questions about Honors, such asTo minor in philosophy, students must take six courses
meeting the following distribution requirements:When you have completed the requirements for the minor,
you should submit a Petition for Confirmation of Minor Program
Completion for Undergraduates. You can download the petition
from 
Letters and Science Advising.
For more detailed information
about declaring the minor, please see the 
Frequently Asked Questions. The Logic Minor at Berkeley consists of three core courses in symbolic
logic, which may be pursued in parallel tracks within Philosophy or
Mathematics, plus a choice of three upper division electives from a list of
courses across Philosophy, Mathematics, Linguistics, and Computer Science.At least two of these electives must be at the undergraduate
level (unless an exception is granted by petition to the
Logic Minor Committee).  Note also that undergraduate enrollment
in graduate seminars requires the consent of the instructor.Please note that at most one upper-division course may be used to satisfy
requirements both for the Logic Minor and your major (see the Guidelines
for Minors Offered by the College of Letters & Science).When you have completed the requirements for the minor,
you should submit a Petition for Confirmation of Minor Program
Completion for Undergraduates. You can download the petition

We digest, we scrape our knees, our toenails grow. From this perspective we seem to be physical creatures in a physical world. But we also see the red of the tomato, we feel the pangs of longing, our humor is stoked by the nice delivery of a joke. We have a conscious mental life the variety and quality of which is difficult to put into words. From this perspective
it may seem very difficult to see ourselves are merely physical organisms. So the problem is this: can both of these perspectives be accounted for within a coherent and broadly natural theory of the mind?Towards an answer to this question we will study the mind from a
philosophical point of view. Our primary question will be: what is the relation between the mind and the physical world? Is the mind part of the physical world? Is our mental life just another physical processes like digestion? Or is it rather that the mind is non-physical in nature and hence that it cannot be accounted for in physical terms?The study of these questions will involve us with dualism, physicalism, the identity theory, behaviorism, functionalism, the problem of consciousness, personal identity, the neural correlates of consciousness and other related issues. We will read Putnam, Descartes, Hume, Chalmers, Smart, Turing, Nagel, Jackson and others.Previously taught:

Home | UC Berkeley | College of Letters & Science | Support philosophy!© 2006-2017 Regents of the University of CaliforniaThis introductory class will examine the works of four classical protagonists of Western political thought: Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. In focusing on early modern political philosophy and, in particular, on contractarian thought, it is meant to provide students with a basic understanding of paradigmatic politico-philosophical approaches: An understanding of the underlying metaphysical and ontological, historical and anthropological assumptions that essentially inform these approaches; of the relevance and specific meaning of concepts such as freedom, justice, citizenship, or power; and, most importantly, of differing argumentative strategies of justifying the existence as well as the authority of the state philosophically. Thus, based on a careful reading of their writings, it is to be considered how Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, and Kant attempt to find a balance that resolves the inescapable tension between (individual) autonomy and (stately) authority. Additionally, the course aims at identifying the concepts of the political that, implicitly or explicitly, organize the theories discussed.Previously taught:
