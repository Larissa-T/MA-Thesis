The seminars are normally led by faculty members, and the topics are determined each year by the Graduate Committee. Students in all years are strongly recommended to attend the professionalization seminars since they are a constitutive part of graduate formation.

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownBrown's doctoral program in English offers professional training in literary criticism, critical theory, intellectual history, and all aspects of research and pedagogy in the humanities.  We promote the analysis of imaginative forms, cultural logics and literary and visual rhetorics across the Anglophone world.  Our students are encouraged to think outside traditional conceptions of the discipline of literary studies, and often work with a diverse range of faculty, departments, and intellectual centers at Brown.  These include the Cogut Center for the Humanities, the Pembroke Center, the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, the Center for Contemporary South Asia, the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America, the Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice, and the Departments of Modern Culture and Media, Comparative Literature, History, American Studies, Africana Studies, Literary Arts, French Studies, German Studies, Hispanic Studies, Brazilian and Portuguese Studies, the History of Art and Architecture, and Music.  The first two years of the doctoral program are devoted to course work and the fulfillment of the foreign language requirement. We expect graduate students to take the Qualifying Examination by the end of the third year. Their remaining time in the program is given to the writing of the dissertation. We expect this project to involve research and to demonstrate the potential to become a book or series of articles during the early years of the student’s career as a college or university professor.Brown’s doctoral program trains graduate students to become teachers as well as researchers. Thus we require that, with some exceptions, our students teach for three years as assistants to members of the English Department faculty and as instructors of sections of ENGL0900 (formerly ENGL0110) Critical Reading and Writing I: The Academic Essay, and ENGL0200 Seminars in Writing, Literatures, and Cultures. This teaching begins in the second year of the program. As part of their course work all students are required to take ENGL2950 Seminar in Pedagogy and Composition Theory. To help develop their teaching skills, we assign students to a variety of teaching positions, from assistant in a large course to instructor of a virtually autonomous workshop. We are convinced that the intellectual relationship between teaching and research is one that stands a college or university teacher in good stead for the duration of his or her career, and we try to establish this relationship early on by assigning graduate students, whenever possible, to teach courses related to their general area of research, and to work with faculty who may serve as appropriate mentors.Graduate students are also required to take one course during their first year of study that has been designated theory-intensive. The theory-intensive course may also satisfy one of the three area requirements listed above. In certain cases, 1000-level courses (intended primarily for undergraduates) may satisfy the theory-intensive requirement.*First-year graduate students are required to take ENGL2210.  This Proseminar aims to familiarize students with contemporary critical debates and stances in the wider discipline, engage with current methodologies, theories, and analytical tensions and address issues of professionalization as they relate to the first years of graduate work.Throughout the year, the Department plans a series of seminars that address a variety of timely academic topics that are meant to enhance the students' professional development, as well as expose them to important elements of an academic career. The seminars are usually led by faculty members, and the topics are determined each year by the Graduate Committee. Students in all years are strongly recommended to attend the professionalization seminars since they are a constitutive part of graduate formation.In their second year at Brown, students who already have an A.M. (or M.A.) in English or graduate credit from another institution may transfer up to one year’s coursework toward the requirements for the Ph.D. at the discretion of the department.Ph.D. candidates can satisfy the language requirement in two ways: by demonstrating either an ability to use two foreign languages in their scholarly and critical work, or the ability to do graduate-level literary work in one foreign language. The department offers its own language exams. Students may ordinarily choose any languages that are appropriate to their research interests, but some fields within English and American literature have specific requirements.The purpose of the Qualifying Examination is to certify your mastery of the scholarly field in which you have chosen to specialize.  It consists of two components:   1) Written Component—an essay of approximately 20 pages representing your best scholarly work to date and submitted to your committee by September 15 of your third year, and 2) Oral Examination—the oral exam is given by a committee of three faculty members chosen by the candidate; it lasts approximately two hours. The exam is taken at the end of the third year, soon after the completion of course work and the foreign language requirement and before the submission of a dissertation proposal and first chapter.  See the Graduate Student Handbook for detailed guidelines.The dissertation is a substantial work of criticism and scholarship that makes a contribution to professionally recognized areas of literary study. The dissertation process begins when the candidate’s proposal and first chapter are approved by a committee in his or her field and accepted by the Director of Graduate Studies. It concludes when the completed dissertation is presented to a committee of three faculty members, including the dissertation director, and successfully defended in discussion with the committee and other interested members of the department.The University offers incoming graduate students five years of guaranteed financial support, including a stipend, tuition remission, a health services fee, a health insurance subsidy, and four years of summer support.  Students are supported by a fellowship in the first year. In years two, three and five, students are supported by a teaching assistantship, and in year four by a dissertation fellowship. Financial support is contingent upon students remaining in good standing in the program and making good progress toward the doctoral degree.Applications must be submitted electronically via the Graduate School's website.  Application materials should not be sent directly to the English Department.The deadline for applications is December 15, 2017. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) general test is required and should be taken well in advance of the application deadline. The GRE report code for Brown University is 3094. The GRE subject test is not required.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownA: As a rule, the Director of Graduate Studies meets with students after they have applied and been accepted into the graduate program.A: We receive approximately three hundred and fifty applications each year, and we are able to offer admission to approximately 18 of those applicants. The Graduate Admissions Committee weighs a number of factors when considering candidates. The admissions committee places the most importance on a candidate's personal statement and writing sample. These pieces of writing must show, first of all, that the applicant would like to be a part of and is capable of succeeding at a graduate program whose goal is to train students to be professional literary scholars. We look for applicants who are asking provocative and potentially productive literary questions and who are interested in exploring such questions in a rigorous intellectual environment. The personal statement and writing sample must also demonstrate that the candidate would fit in well with our program's strengths. Third, they must show that the candidate has the skills and abilities required for those who are to be trained in literary studies. Obviously, a candidate's undergraduate and -- if applicable -- graduate record is very important in determining admission, as are test scores and letters of recommendation. A: We have no official requirement regarding the length of the writing sample. We ask that you send us a piece or pieces of your writing so that we can determine from this material if you have the necessary skills to succeed as a graduate student in English and, ultimately, a professional literary scholar at a major university. Such skills would include an ability to produce close, careful readings of texts as well as the ability to situate those readings in the context of a challenging and focused argument. Twenty-five pages would not be too much to send. A four-five page analytical paper would be far too short. Whatever you send, we strongly recommend that you seek the counsel of a faculty member at your present school (if you are currently attending one) or one of your previous institutions who has some familiarity with the current state of debates in literary studies.A: We have no official requirement regarding the length of the personal statement, although the typical length is between one and three pages.A: The GRE general test is required. The test should be taken well in advance of the application deadline. The GRE reporting code for Brown University is 3094.  There is no department reporting code. The GRE subject test is not required.A: The department has no minimum GRE score requirement, nor do we have an official policy stipulating an acceptable range of GRE scores.A: Yes. Brown University requires this exam. Further information can be found on the Graduate School's website at http://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/international-students-language-proficiency-toefl-or-ielts.A: Yes. Your record, however, must demonstrate substantial coursework and research ability in literary studies.A:  Yes.  However, you must submit electronically two applications and two sets of materials as well as pay two application fees.  If you are accepted into both programs, you will only be allowed to matriculate in one or the other.A:   No. The M.A. program has been indefinitely suspended; however, a transitional M.A., the B.A./M.A. program, and the Open Graduate M.A. program are available to in-house Brown students.A: The University offers incoming graduate students five years of guaranteed financial support, including a stipend, tuition remission, a health services fee, a health insurance subsidy, and four years of summer support.  Students are supported by a fellowship in the first year. In years two, three and five, students are supported by a teaching assistantship, and in year four by a dissertation fellowship. Financial support is contingent upon students remaining in good standing in the program and making good progress toward the doctoral degree.A: We do not have a Film/Media Studies track within the Ph.D. program. The Department of Modern Culture and Media offers a doctoral program in Modern Culture & Media.A: No. Acceptance into the Ph.D. program cannot be deferred from one year to another. If you are unable to begin graduate studies in September, you will need to reapply.A: Applications and supporting materials cannot be reactivated from one year to the next.A:  The deadline for submitting applications for the academic year 2018-19 is December 15, 2017.A: Detailed information and the online application is available on the Graduate School's website at https://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/application-information. A:  Contact the Graduate School admission staff at graduate_admissions@brown.edu to avoid any mishaps with admission materials.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe English Honors Program is intended for students who have been highly successful in their English concentration coursework and who want the opportunity to pursue a research project in more depth than is possible in an undergraduate seminar. The program is intended for those students with a strong desire to conduct independent research under the supervision of a thesis advisor and culminates in the writing of a thesis during the senior year.Students apply to the Honors Program early in the second semester of their junior year. December or mid-year graduates may apply in their 6th semester, but are encouraged to apply during their 5th semester and write their theses alongside May graduates. Interested concentrators should speak to the Honors Advisor early in their junior year to discuss their plans. Specific deadlines for admission are announced annually and are available on the department website. Students who are studying off campus are expected to meet the application submission deadline.Admission to the English Honors Program depends on evidence of ability and promise in the study of literature. To be eligible for admission, students must have received more As than Bs (and no Cs or below) in concentration courses completed. Students must complete an application; supply a brief writing sample, and request two letters of recommendation from English faculty with whom they have taken courses. If necessary, letters may come from faculty in related departments. Letters from teaching assistants may only serve as supporting recommendations. Candidates must also submit a one-page project proposal signed by the faculty member who has agreed to serve as the thesis advisor. See procedures and application for more details.December or mid-year graduates who wish to apply to honors have two options, but the first is highly encouraged:  Option 1:In their 5th semester (Spring), students apply to the honors program along with the other juniors. Accepted students will be incorporated into the regular honors cohort and must meet the same deadlines: i.e. they must complete their theses at the same time as the other honors students (though for mid-years this will be at the end of their 7th semester). They register for ENGL1991 English Honors Seminar in the Fall, and ENGL1992 Senior Honors Thesis in the Spring.Option 2:In the 7th semester (the Spring of their final year), students take an independent study with their thesis advisor, under whose direction they will begin to research and write their theses. This course must be taken S/NC.In the 8th semester (the Fall of their final year), as they complete their theses, students take ENGL1992 for a grade. Mid-year graduates should consult with the Honors Director for information about deadlines.The course requirements for the English Honors Program are the same as those for the regular concentration, with the following additions:As part of regular coursework, and counting toward the concentration requirements, honors candidates must complete at least three upper-level seminars or comparable small courses in which students have the opportunity to do independent research, take significant responsibility for discussion, and do extensive scholarly and critical writing.  Students are encouraged to include at least one graduate seminar in their program. (Permission to take a graduate course must be obtained from the instructor.) Honors candidates should discuss their proposed course of study with the Honors Advisor.During the Fall and Spring of the senior year, honors candidates must complete two additional courses beyond the ten courses required by the regular concentration: ENGL 1991 and ENGL 1992. ENGL 1991 is the Senior Honors Seminar, in which students begin to research and write their theses, as well as meet to discuss their work. This is a mandatory S/NC course. ENGL 1992, the Senior Honors Thesis is an independent research course that must be taken for a grade.Honors candidates must continue to receive more As than Bs in courses taken as part of the concentration.  Courses completed with a grade of C will not count toward an Honors concentration. A student who receives such a grade and wishes to continue in the program must complete a comparable course with a grade higher than C. The Honors thesis is an extended essay, usually between 50 and 80 pages, written under the supervision of a department faculty advisor and second reader. (Where appropriate, the advisor or the reader, but not both, may be in another department.) The thesis may be an interdisciplinary or creative project, but it is usually an essay on a scholarly or critical problem dealing with works of literature in English. The specific topic and approach of the thesis are worked out between the student and the thesis advisor, with assistance from the student's second reader. This process should begin in the latter part of the student's junior year. A good way to get an idea of what sorts of projects are possible is to visit the Hay Library, which stores theses from previous years, or to meet with the Honors Advisor.A prospectus describing the project and endorsed by the faculty advisor must be submitted to the Honors Advisor at the beginning of the senior year. At the end of the senior year fall term, a student must submit approximately 25 pages of draft material toward the thesis. Full thesis drafts are due by mid-March; final bound copies of the thesis are due in mid-April. Late theses will not be accepted for honors after the April deadline; students who hand in theses after the deadline but before the end of the term will receive a grade for the thesis course, but they will not be eligible for departmental honors. The completed thesis will be evaluated by the student's advisor and a second reader, each of whom provides written commentary and suggests a grade for ENGL1992.The English Department reviews the academic record as well as the thesis evaluations for each senior completing the Honors Program. Following a successful review, the student will be eligible to graduate with Honors in English.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

This report is intended to help students navigate the sometimes-frantic shopping period by letting them see which courses may have openings. The report is updated regularly.In the fall of 2006, The Expository Writing Program changed its title to The Nonfiction Writing Program in the English Department at Brown. The content of the program remains nonfiction in all its many sub-genres -- the academic essay, journalism, and creative nonfiction (memoir, literary journalism, lyric essay, historical narrative, travel essay, science writing, and cultural critique).The Nonfiction Writing Program attracts students from all disciplines by offering courses ranging from critical reading and writing to real world writing. We are as concerned with the discourse of university intellectual life as with writing for non-academic audiences. To that end, the Nonfiction Writing Program brings together three forms of writing: academic essay, journalism, and creative nonfiction. The factual precision of journalism, the narrative and essayistic latitudes of creative nonfiction, and the intellectual rigor of academic discourse offer perspectives from which we can critique and rethink the conventional boundaries of each form of writing. We seek to redefine practices of reading and writing and thereby to gain a new perspective on our experiences with language. All classes are conducted in small seminar settings.Please consider joining our Nonfiction News Group where program announcements (readings, special events, contests), news of writing opportunities (summer and academic year internships, jobs, etc), and publication solicitations will be posted. If you would like something posted, please contact the Listserv administrators, Elizabeth Taylor, Lawrence Stanley or Catherine Imbriglio. One of us will post your message.

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownQ: Should I take ENGL0900 (formerly 0110) in my first semester/year? Or should I first take an English course in the area of my interest?A: Taking ENGL0900 (formerly 0110) in your first semester will give you a good background in the skills of critical reading and writing helpful in other academic courses. If you are reasonably competent at critical reading and writing, however, taking other lower-level courses in English should give you what you need and/or help you to assess your writing abilities so that you can choose a writing course that more precisely meets your needs.Q: How can I determine if I should take ENGL0900 (formerly 0110) or ENGL1030 (formerly 0130)? Can my AP scores or my SAT scores guide me in choosing a writing course? If I have already had analytical writing instruction in high school and have written relatively long research papers, why should I take a writing course at Brown?A: ENGL0900 (formerly 0110) will instruct you in the concepts and methods of critical inquiry, whereas ENGL1030 (formerly 0130) -- which deals more with individual research -- requires a higher level of writing competency. Although high scores in standardized tests demonstrate knowledge and competence, the specific demands of university writing often differ from those evaluated by standardized tests. Q: If I am interested in concentrating in English, should I take a writing course, or should I take one of the introductory topics courses prior to taking a writing course?A: Concentrating in English requires a good background in critical reading and writing. If you are reasonably competent at critical reading and writing, taking an introductory literature course first will help you learn more about your strengths and weaknesses as a writer. You will then be able to choose a writing course that more precisely meets your needs.Q: For which section of ENGL0900 (formerly 0110) should I register?A: Read the individual descriptions for each section and choose the one that interests you the most. The number of sections offered allows you to choose a section that works well with the rest of your schedule. Q: As an ESL student, how can I determine my preparedness for writing at Brown? Can my GCE scores serve as a guideline for assessing my writing abilities?A: Although high GCE scores reflect competence in the English language, ESL students benefit from the intensity of individual writing instruction. ENGL0900 (formerly 0110) will familiarize you with the practices of writing in an American university.Q: My concentration requires that I take two English courses. Which courses will fulfill that requirement?A: You must check with your department to see what is required.Q: How do I submit a writing sample for a course that requires one?A: For nonfiction writing courses that require a writing sample, individual instructors have different requirements; these will be explained on the first day of class.Q: What are the differences among ENGL0930 (formerly 0180), ENGL1050, and ENGL1180? How can I know which is best for me?A: ENGL0930 (formerly 0180) will introduce you to creative nonfiction and to its various subgenres; it has no prerequisites, although you should be personally committed to writing.  ENGL 1050, an intermediate-level seminar in nonfiction, also has no prerequisites but has been designed for experienced writers wanting to concentrate on specific subgenres.  As an advanced writing course, ENGL1180 requires a high level of competence in writing and a working familiarity with creative nonfiction.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Nonfiction Writing Honors Program is intended for students who have been highly successful in their English concentration work. Specifically, it allows those who have an expressed and proven interest in nonfiction writing to pursue more completely a single project under the supervision of a first reader. The intention is to help students to complete work worthy of publication. The program culminates in the writing of a thesis during the senior year.Students apply to the Nonfiction Writing Honors Program in the second semester of their junior year. December or mid-year graduates may apply in their 6th semester, but are encouraged to apply during their 5th semester and write their theses alongside May graduates.  Interested students should already have made contact with at least one member of the Nonfiction Writing faculty and should meet with the Honors Advisor to discuss their proposed plans.  Specific deadlines for admission are announced annually and are available on the department website. Students who are studying off campus are expected to meet the application submission deadline.Admission to the Honors Program in Nonfiction Writing depends upon a student's demonstrated superior ability in nonfiction writing. Students must have taken either one intermediate and one advanced writing course, or two advanced writing courses by the end of their sixth semester and completed each with an S. To be eligible for admission, students must have earned more As than Bs (and no Cs or below) in other courses in the concentration plan.  Students  must submit an application, three letters of recommendation, a writing  sample from an advanced writing course, and a project proposal.See procedures and application for more details.December or mid-year graduates who wish to apply for nonfiction honors have two options, but the first is highly encouraged:Option 1:In their 5th semester (Spring), students can apply to the nonfiction honors program along with the other juniors. Accepted students will be incorporated into the regular nonfiction honors cohort and must meet the same deadlines: i.e. they must complete their theses at the same time as the other honors students (though for mid-years this will be at the end of their 7th semester). They register for ENGL1993 Nonfiction Honors Seminar in the Fall and ENGL1994 Senior Honors Thesis in Nonfiction in the Spring.Option 2:In their 7th semester (the Spring of their final year) students take ENGL1200 and in their 8th semester (the Fall of their final year) they take ENGL1994. (Students choosing this option must consult with the Honors Advisor for information on deadlines.)Students in the Nonfiction Writing Honors Program take two additional courses beyond the ten courses required by the Nonfiction Writing Track -- ENGL1993 Honors Seminar in Nonfiction Writing (with the Honors Advisor) and ENGL1994 Senior Honors Thesis in Nonfiction Writing; the Honors track will bring to twelve the total number of required courses. The ENGL1993 grade option must be S/NC; ENGL1994 must be taken for a grade. Honors candidates should discuss their proposed course of study with the faculty member they choose to direct their thesis.Honors candidates must continue to receive more As than Bs in courses taken as part of the concentration.  Courses completed with a grade of C will not count toward an Honors concentration. A student who receives a "C" after admission to Nonfiction Honors and wishes to continue in the program must complete an additional course in a comparable subject area, with a grade higher than C.The Nonfiction Writing Honors thesis is an extended project, usually of between 50 and 80 pages, written under the supervision of one of the Nonfiction Writing faculty and a second reader (who can be from literature or another department). The specific topic and approach of the thesis are worked out between the student and the first reader, with assistance from the student's second reader. A good way to get an idea of what sorts of projects are possible is to visit the Hay Library, which stores theses from previous years, or to meet with the Honors Advisor. The work typically is in a genre chosen from Nonfiction Writing's spectrum: critical analysis, literary journalism, memoir, lyric essay, or narrative based on travel, science, history, or cultural critique.Full thesis drafts are due by mid-March; final bound copies of the thesis are due in mid-April. Late theses will not be accepted for honors after the April deadline; students who hand in theses after the deadline and before the end of the term will receive a grade for the thesis course, but they will not be eligible for departmental honors. The completed thesis will be evaluated by its first reader and second reader, each of whom provides written commentary and suggests a grade for ENGL1994.The English Department reviews the academic record as well as the thesis evaluations for each senior completing the Nonfiction Writing Honors Program. Following a successful review, the student will be eligible to graduate with Honors in Nonfiction Writing.Secure second reader for thesis and submit signed acknowledgment to Catherine Imbriglio, Honors Advisor for Nonfiction Writing.  Prospectus is due to the Honors Advisor, first reader, and second reader.

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownIn 1997 the Department of English charged Lawrence Stanley and Elizabeth Taylor to assess the department's writing curriculum and, based upon this assessment, to set up a complete and coherent program of writing instruction.Our first task was to transform a disorganized assortment of courses into a semi-autonomous state-of-the-art writing program tailored to serve both the academic needs of Brown students and their professional aspirations for the future.Within a year, we had designed a completely new curriculum broader than traditional composition courses. Instead, we combined academic scholarship with courses in journalism and various forms of nonfiction that help students pursue careers as writers within the sciences and social sciences as well as the humanities.Within a community of fellow writers, students can now progress from introductory to advanced nonfiction writing courses.The Nonfiction Writing Program offers three levels of academic writing courses. ENGL0900, the introduction to academic writing, is neither basic nor remedial; rather, it introduces students to the rigor and discipline of critical reading and writing at the university level and thereby brings them into the intellectual life of the academy. ENGL1030 is a research essay course, which takes students through all the phases and processes of formulating a subject and the terms of inquiry and leads them through library research. ENGL1140 is an advanced academic writing class intended for students who want to explore the theoretical suppositions and practices of cultural analysis (emphasizing the literary, but not to the exclusion of other fields of study).The demand for creative nonfiction has steadily increased. The introductory course familiarizes students with narrative structures of creative nonfiction and with its various subgenre: the personal essay, memoir, literary journalism, science writing, travel writing, historical narrative, and other forms. Here the program also offers three levels of courses.  Students can then pursue a specific subgenre in an advanced writing seminar. We now have a clearly established progression from introductory to advanced writing classes out of which we have built up a body of genuinely advanced writers.Journalism supplements the program's other offerings with intermediate and advanced courses. Students get first-hand, professional-level experience as they work with full-time journalists. This instruction has had a direct impact on student publications (The Brown Daily Herald, The College Hill Independent) and productions such as Brown Student Radio. It has also had a constructive impact on the teaching and learning of creative nonfiction and academic writing; in journalism, students learn how to research and construct story outside the traditional paradigms of academia.Students can choose a track in Nonfiction Writing within the English concentration. They can also apply to do an honors project in creative nonfiction, journalism, or cultural analysis. The Nonfiction Writing track now attracts more than 20% of the concentrators in English, thus broadening and deepening the mission of the Department of English.--Lawrence K. Stanley and Elizabeth S.

As director of Beacon Press in Boston she produced two characteristically influential bestsellers -- Marian Wright Edelman's The Measure of Our Success and Cornel West's Race Matters. Under her tenure, revenues tripled, and in 1993 her fellow publishers named her "Woman of the Year" for her courage in speaking out during several First Amendment controversies. In 1995 Strothman joined Houghton Mifflin as executive vice president in charge of the reference and trade divisions. There again she revived an institution with a noble history. "There's been a lot of cynicism in the publishing community," she told BAM in 2000, "and low morale in the industry-first because of the chains, then Amazon, and then this looming threat of e-books. What people tend to forget is that quality still sells." Now, having resigned from Houghton Mifflin Strothman is expanding the Boston literary agency she established in the fall of 2003. "It may not be every publisher's dream. But after being kicked upstairs as far as I was, at some point you want to be back close to the books again," said Strothman. The Strothman Agency specializes in narrative nonfiction-memoir, history, science and nature-and selected fiction. Strothman has also helped form a TV production company, Prologue Productions, together with author James Carroll and agent Don Cutler. The studio will produce Carroll's bestselling Constantine's Sword, which Strothman edited, as a TV series, with Orin Jacoby, who has done work for PBS and the BBC.TV: ABC, CBS, and NBC in Providence, NYC, and Minnesota; MSNBC in NYC; National Geographic TelevisionRadio: NPR, WBRU, WRNI, Oregon and Wyoming Public RadioNewspapers: The Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Oregonian, Providence Journal, Boston Globe, Miami Herald, New Orleans Times Picayune, The New York Observer, New York Times, Washington Post, The Dallas Morning News, The Sacramento Bee, San Francisco Chronicle, Arizona Star, The Arizona Republic, Minneapolis Star Tribune, Tampa Tribune, St. Petersburg Times, Newport Daily News, The Buffalo News, AP wire service, the Dow Jones energy wire service; Weeklies: Atlanta, GA and Millerton, NY, the Providence Phoenix, The Chronicle of Higher Education, The Chronicle of PhilanthropyMagazines: Vogue, The New Republic, Esquire, The Paris Review, Glamour Magazine, National Geographic, Mother Jones, Popular Science, Self, New Yorker, Discover Magazine, The Smithsonian Magazine, Science Magazine, American Prospect Magazine, Spin Magazine, Billboard Magazine, Brown Alumni Monthly, Glimpse Magazine, McSweeney's, The Nation, House and Garden Magazine, Outside Magazine, U.S. News & World Report, Rolling Stone, AgniWebzines: The Huffington Post; Glimpse Magazine; Slate.com; Salon.com; 6Billion, a webzine of multi-discipline creative nonfictionPublic Relations in a hospital, historical society, nongovernmental organizations and nonprofitsGrants: Luce Foundation grants for young journalists; Fulbrights for work with writers and writingGraduate School: Film school, law school, Columbia School of Journalism, MFA programs in Creative Nonfiction at Columbia, Iowa, Montana, EmersonTeaching: undergraduate and graduate students: High school English and writing; College literature and writingPublished: in literary journals such as Seneca Review, Gulf Coast, Creative Nonfiction Magazine; Books: Laura Rothenburg: My So-Called Lungs; Kevin Roose: The Unlikely Disciple: A Sinner's Semester at America's Holiest University; Lindsay Harrison: MissingProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
