          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department offers all levels of instruction in Russian language, literature, and culture. Upper level Russian language courses, in addition to all advanced literature and culture courses (sequences above 1000), serve both graduate students and undergraduate concentrators in Slavic Studies; they also attract students whose interests range across the entire university curriculum.Students of International Relations and Comparative Literature are particularly well-represented among our learners, quite a few of whom go on to study and/or work abroad. All students in need of advanced levels of instruction in Russian make considerable use of the state-of-the-art audio-visual and multimedia offerings of Brown's Language Resource Center. Our language courses also provide valuable classroom experience to graduate students in the Department preparing for teaching careers.An appointment as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Fellow requires taking part both in a pre-service Second Language TA Workshop and in-service meetings with the course coordinator. These acquaint TAs with issues of language acquisition and pedagogy, and seek to influence both the development of the TAs' philosophy of teaching and their teaching practice.Eighteenth-Century Russian Literature (RUSS2010)Movements and Genres in Russian Literary Culture (RUSS2410)Seminars in Russian Literature (RUSS2610, 2620, 2710, 2720)Theories of Literature (COLT2650)Seminar in the History of Early Modern Europe (HI2070)Seminar in European Social History in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries (HIST 2080)Revolution as a Work of Art (TAPS2120)Abstraction and Resistance (TAPS2200)Proseminar in Political Theory (POLS2120)Theory and Methods of Foreign Language Teaching (GRMN, FREN2900)More detailed course information can be found by performing a search on Brown's Course Preview.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe doctoral program in Slavic Studies focuses largely on modern  Russian and Czech cultures. The doctoral program in these regions  thereby covers a critical area of European and Eurasian studies at  Brown. The program's vigor derives from strong and dedicated faculty,  including 7 full time Slavic Department faculty and 3 faculty with joint  appointments in Slavic and related departments.The doctoral program in Slavic Studies distinguishes itself  from traditional programs in Slavic that focus exclusively on literary  studies. It allows for variable degrees of interdisciplinary and  intercultural studies. Students work with departmental faculty as well  as with faculty in related fields such as comparative literature,  theater and performance studies, history, political science, and  international relations. Students in our program are prepared to become  flexible and innovative scholars in their research and teaching, who  address varying teaching and research needs in the future job market.  Outstanding library holdings in West and South Slavic languages and  cultures at Brown and courses through Brown-Harvard exchange program  offer yet additional excellent resources for research.In addition to receiving training in related disciplines, the  doctoral students amass experience in teaching languages and  literatures. Mentoring in teaching occurs in various contexts: in  language and literature courses, where they serve as teaching  assistants, in the interdepartmental foreign language teaching methods  course (and related practice), and in seminars at The Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning. Students will receive extensive advice on research strategies, conference presentations, and publication of their works. Additional information is available at the Graduate School Program website.Normally course work and the preliminary examinations are  completed by the end of the third year, submission of the doctoral  thesis proposal during the fourth, and one or two years of work to  complete the doctoral thesis. We expect our students to be supported by  scholarships during their first year, by teaching fellowships/assistantships during their second to fourth years, and by a dissertation fellowship during their last year. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown What is Slavic? The term refers to the branch of the Indo-European language family that includes Russian, Ukrainian, and Belorussian (East Slavic), Polish, Czech, Sorbian, Slovak (West Slavic), and Bulgarian, Slovenian, Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, and Macedonian (South Slavic). The number of speakers of all Slavic languages is estimated to be 315 million, of which the most commonly spoken languages are Russian (145 million), Polish (43 million), Ukrainian (39.5 million), Czech (11 million), and Serbian (11 million). In addition, Russian is used as a second language in most of the countries of the former Soviet Union.The Department of Slavic Studies at Brown focuses on three of the most commonly spoken Slavic languages: Russian, Czech, and Polish. Although closely related linguistically and geographically, Russia, Poland, and the Czech Republic followed different paths in history, culture, religion, arts, and politics. Yet their histories are interrelated and exemplify both cultural cross-fertilization and often tumultuous confrontations that are connected with national aspirations and ambitions. They continue to be key players in the constantly changing political landscape of Central and Eastern Europe; their recent histories—most notably Poland and the Czech Republic  joining of the European Union—reflect the tensions and hopes of all European countries.Our program’s objective is to provide students who are interested in Russian, Polish, and Czech languages, literatures, histories and cultures with an in-depth understanding of cultural, economic, and political processes in Eastern and Central Europe. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the East European Socialist bloc, these countries have undergone rapid economic and political changes and actively engaged in global politics. The professional paths of our former concentrators demonstrate that studying Russian and/or Polish and Czech is a major asset to students considering careers in such diverse fields as international relations and diplomacy, law, business, teaching and academic research. Our program allows students to engage deeply with some of the richest literary traditions in the world, and to examine them in their historical, political contexts – from Russian classics like the works of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov and Nabokov, to brilliant Central and East European writers like Schulz, Gombrowicz, Hrabal and Kundera.    Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
