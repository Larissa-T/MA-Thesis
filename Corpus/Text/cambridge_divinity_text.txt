Faculty of DivinityStudying at CambridgeThe MPhil in Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion is a nine-month Masters course that offers the opportunity for advanced study in across the full range of subject areas represented in the Faculty. Students can draw on the expertise of leading scholars from a wide range of subjects, which allows both for specialistation and for interdisciplinary approaches. The MPhil is designed for students who wish to study their subject of interest at an advanced level, but also to enable those who wish to undertake further research at doctoral level to acquire the necessary skills and understanding.Information about all postgraduate degrees of the University of Cambridge can be found via the graduate admissions page of the Graduate Admissions Office, the central body which deals with all graduate applications for the whole University. The set of pages on the MPhil in Theology and Religious Studies is here.You should submit your application to the Graduate Admissions Office following the guidance on that admissions page.Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit their applications as early as possible. This is particularly important for applicants seeking Gates or Cambridge funding, who should note the following deadlines.When you apply you should submit a research proposal of around 500 words, along with a sample of written work between 20-25 pages in length.Many of these seminar courses and subject areas will be offered in 2018-19 and 2019-20. Applicants in all subject areas are expected to have achieved 1st class or 2.1 honours degree with marks of at least 67%; or a GPA of at least 3.8; or performance at an equivalent level in an honours degree.New Testament and Early Christianity applicants are required to have at least two years study of New Testament Greek.Philosophy of Religion applicants must have a strong philosophical background and relevant theological knowledge.Old Testament applicants must have knowledge of the relevant biblical languages, notably biblical Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.Religions of Antiquity applicants must have knowledge of Greek or Latin.World Christianities applicants need to have a first degree in Theology, Religious Studies, History, Anthropology or another discipline involving contemporary cross-cultural study.Applications are now open for the part-time M.Phil. course.

To that end, students are required to complete a thesis of between 15,000 and 20,000 words in length (including footnotes and appendices but excluding bibliography) on a subject approved by the Degree Committee. Students are assigned a supervisor for their thesis in the Michaelmas Term.Students are also required to take two modules, one in Michaelmas Term and one in Lent Term, and one exercise. Modules normally take the form of four, two-hour seminars over the course of a term.  The module taken in Michaelmas Term must be in the student’s principal subject area (e.g., Christian Theology, New Testament, etc.). Student can take in the Lent Term a module of their choice. For each module, the student must submit an essay of not more than 5,000 words in length, or an equivalent exercise, at least one of which must fall within the same subject area as the candidate’s thesis or be otherwise suitably related to it.The exercise component of the course can be fulfilled in one of three ways:either (i) one paper of three hours' duration on a language chosen from a list of languages published by the Degree Committee.or (ii) one exercise on a subject chosen from a list of subjects for exercises approved by the Degree Committee.or (iii) an alternative exercise within the candidate's chosen subject areaM.Phil. students are also expected to attend the senior seminar associated with their area of study. These meet regularly during term time and are occasions where academics from Cambridge and elsewhere read and discuss papers.

Faculty of DivinityStudying at CambridgeThe 2017 Film Competition opened on 11 September and will close on Friday 15 December.This year the theme is religious objects. We are looking for creative films that engage with an artefact, text, building, painting, sculpture etc. that may be central to religious practises or an artistic response to religion.The competition is open to students in Years 9-13. Either in a team or your own you should produce a film lasting no more than 5 minutes.It can take any form, such as a debate, documentary or artistic response. We are keen to allow students to interpret this in a variety of ways and so films may reflect on one religious tradition or approach it from a comparative perspective; look to answer a specific question or focus on religion through the lens of literature, history, sociology, language, politics, or science.We expect that students will read around the subject area to inform the content of the film. Any claims should be substantiated and sources quoted in the piece should be acknowledged in a written or spoken form. We would like to remind entrants that permission must be sought to use any image, music or film that is in copyright and if granted, this must be stated at the end of the film. It is not sufficient to provide a link to online content. You can find guidance about what copyright is, what it applies to, who owns it and how long it lasts at www.gov.uk/topic/intellectual-property/copyright You are also required to include a disclaimer stating that the film is your work and does not necessarily reflect the views of the Faculty of Divinity.The judges will be looking to reward innovative films that make use of the visual medium to communicate their thoughts. They will not, however, make the award on the quality of the filming or editing. There is a prize fund of £500 to be awarded to the best entries. The closing date is 15th December.How to enterWhen you have finished your film, you should upload it to YouTube www.youtube.com/.

The teaching is great and the staff have made this, easily, my favourite module.""Absolutely great – I have loved this course and it has been great fun learning this language and it is a valuable skill.""Lectures/classes have taken into account different levels of grammatical knowledge and gone at an appropriate pace – taking time for everyone to understand.""I thought I would find Greek quite hard, but the staff are making the subject very accessible and I am greatly enjoying it. Thank you – looking forward to next term."Anonymous student feedback forms, 2014-15 In your first year you will select five modules (papers) to study. One of these will be a scriptural language. This will give you foundational skills that you will need throughout your course of study.As the languages are new to the majority of undergraduates, we are often asked lots of questions about studying them at Cambridge. We hope that the answers below are helpful and you may also wish to read the more detailed information found at www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/data/PartI.pdf If you have a question that isn't answered here, please get in touch with our Outreach Officer, Laura Jeffrey, outreach@divinity.cam.ac.ukMore information about the other papers you can choose from in your first year (Part I) is available at www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/outreach/whatDeveloping a knowledge of a scriptural language will give you a deeper understanding of the religion it relates to and will support your study in that area. Additionally, you’ll become aware of the impact of translations on studies of scripture. By reading some of the original language, you will be able to comment on different versions of a text and reflect on the impact they may have on our understanding of the religion.You do not need to achieve certain grades in modern or classical languages at A-level or GCSE to apply to study Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion at Cambridge.  In fact, a good proportion of students have not formally studied any language beyond the age of 14.  All our classes are therefore designed to cater for complete beginners.The teaching of scriptural languages is of an excellent standard at Cambridge. Staff are supportive and attentive to the differing needs of students. You will be in small groups that meet regularly during term. This will enable you to become familiar with terms and concepts quickly. You’ll make satisfying progress so that you feel comfortable with the language well before the exams at the end of the year.You select one language from Hebrew, New Testament Greek, Qur'anic Arabic or Sanskrit. These relate to the core religions taught in the Faculty, respectively Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism and Buddhism.The scriptural languages are taught in the written form. The emphasis is on learning the grammar and vocabulary you need to be able to start reading the language. Therefore most of your work will be reading and writing in the language. You will of course learn pronunciation in class, but there is no assessed oral component.Most students are new to the language they will be learning and so no prior experience is assumed. However, if you choose to learn New Testament Greek, an online course is available to introduce you to key concepts before you arrive in Cambridge www.greek.divinity.cam.ac.uk.Although not aimed at students new to the language, if you are interested in studying Hebrew, you may wish to look at the Artefacts of Ancient Judaism website to give you a flavour of what understanding a language will enable you to do http://artefacts.lib.cam.ac.uk/index.html There are three classes a week, lasting between one and one and half hours. Some students will have a greater aptitude for language learning and be more familiar with grammatical concepts. Where numbers permit, students may be grouped into different classes to help support their language learning.In addition, students receive a number of supervisions during the year and revision classes in the before exams.Our students study a small section of each text; you’ll be very familiar with it by the end of the year. Details of the specific texts covered are available at www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/data/PartI.pdfYou will be asked to translate passages from the scriptural language into English from prescribed text(s), comment on grammatical forms, and translate sentences from English into the scriptural language.Students are only required to study a scriptural language in their first year.Many students carry on with the language in the second year and some will continue into their third year. It is also possible to start a new language in your second or third year (at beginners’ level).© 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

The Hebrew Bible2. New Testament3. Classical Rabbinic Literature4 The Qur’anModule ObjectivesThe aim of the module is, firstly, to enable students to develop their skills of textual analysis and of hermeneutic of scriptural and legal reception in early Christian, rabbinic, and Qur’anic traditions.  Secondly, the module aims to provide M.Phil. students with tools for comparative cross-traditional textual and conceptual analysis.  Thirdly, the module seeks to enable students to draw connections between analysis of concrete legal topics (in this case, that of ritual purity) and broader conceptual-theological themes (eg, universalism and humanity) within the three scriptural traditions under consideration.  In addition, in terms of comparative historical content, students should develop a clear sense of the importance and development of ‘ritual law for gentiles’ in Early Christianity, rabbinic Judaism and Islam.PrerequisitesAll texts will be presented in translation as well as in the original languages, primarily Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic.  There are no specific language prerequisites, but students are encouraged to prepare and engage texts in original languages that they know.Mode of AssessmentAssessment for the module will take the form of a submitted 5,000-word essay.  Each student will choose a topic for the essay in consultation with the coordinators of the M.Phil. module.Sample Essay QuestionsHow do two (or all three) of the three traditions studied in the module deal with and reinterpret the heritage of the Hebrew Bible?What is the relationship between purity laws for Jews and non-Jews in the Hebrew Bible in two (or all three) of the traditions studies in the module?What role does the discourse about Jewish ethnicity play in two (or all three) of the three traditions studied in the module?What is the historical impact of Paul’s letters on Christian discourse concerning the “Noahide laws”?How do the Noahide laws develop from Tannaitic to Amoraic Judaism?How can we understand the shift towards treating blood as a factor of impurity, for gentitles, within the Hebrew Bible?How is our understanding of the concept of ‘universalism’ affected by examining the conceptuality of purity laws for gentiles within two (or all three) of the three traditions studied in the module?Essay titles must be agreed with the course coordinators, and subsequently by the Degree Committee.Lent Term 2018Anthropology of Islam in Contemporary EuropeCourse Coordinator: Mr Chris Moses This is a non-specialist module within the Study of World Religions pathway, which takes a broadly anthropological approach to the study of Islam and Muslims in contemporary Europe.Lived Islam in Europe is dynamic, varied, and complex.  This M.Phil. module will explore some key areas of academic and wider interest in the subject area.  Drawing on a number of excellent case studies, it seeks to tackle the subject in depth and breath.There will be four fortnightly seminars.  The seminar topics are listed below: topic 1 is compulsory, and students will then choose any three of the remaining four.  There will also be some flexibility regarding which areas students would like to focus upon within a particular seminar.1.  Methodology and Reflexivity     Example foci: terminological debates, theory, academic reflexivity2   Constructing Identity     Example foci: practice, ethnicity, transnationalism, inter-religious relations3   Structuring Community     Example foci: authority, institutions, education, rituals4   Culture and Society     Example foci: gender, youth, dress5   Political Engagement     Example foci: state-religion relations, secular liberalism, public sphereStudents will be set readings in advance of each class.  Before the meeting, students will send an A4 page offering a critical analysis of the readings to the coordinator.  In class, students will take turns to present readings and lead group discussion.Aims: This module aims to develop students’ knowledge and understanding of Muslim and Islam in Europe from a social science perspective through reading, analysing and discussing texts, and writing a substantial essay on this subject.Objectives: Students will; (1) read and analyse a series of texts exploring a series of issues of academic and wider interest pertaining to Islam and Muslims in Europe,  (2) develop their presentational skills in a seminar setting, (3) develop their academic writing skills, (4) explore the diversity and complexity of Muslim experiences in Europe, (5) analyse the contested nature of particular concepts within their field of study, (6) evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of anthropological approaches to their object of study, (7) consider the wider significance of the understanding they have gained from the course for related areas in the fields of anthropology and religious studies, and (8) develop an understanding of the role of research for their object of study.Description of assessmentCoursework essay of 5,000 words.  Students may wish to select an essay from the list below, in consultation with the course coordinator.  Any alternative essay title will need the approval of the course coordinator, and subsequently the approval of the degree committee.  Alternatively, they may wish to formulate their own title, subject to the approval of the course coordinator and the Degree Committee.  The latter option has proved popular with students thus far, often wanting to develop their interest in a specific area.  Students wishing to pursue this option are recommended to discuss their plans at an early stage with the Module Coordinator, who will be happy to advise.Suggested Essay Titles1        Does it make sense to speak of ‘European Islam’?2        What is Muslim identity?3        What structures Muslim ‘community’?4        Among European Muslims, what is the significance of national context for any of the following? (i) Gender; (ii) Youth; (iii) Dress.5        What, if anything, is unique about the political engagement of European Muslims?6        ‘Muslims are present in Europe and yet absent from it.’ (Talal Asad) Discuss.7        ‘… it seems obvious that there is hardly anything except Islam that could constitute a common denominator for Eastern and Western European Muslims.’ (Katarzyna Górak-Sosnowska) Discuss.8        What are the strengths and weaknesses of ‘Muslim’ as an analytical lens?9        Can the anthropological study of Islam in Europe generate any theological insight?10    What is at stake in the academic study of European Muslims? Before the Qur’ān: Texts, monuments, perceptionsCourse Coordinator: Professor Garth Fowden An approach to the Qur’ān at the moment of its conception, as texts arising from a late antique socio-historical context.  What is the evidence that permits us to enter this context, and what are the researcher’s preferred methods?  How was the pre-Qur’anic world filtered for early Muslim consumption?  Four main types of evidence are addressed: pre-Islamic Arabic poetry; architecture, art and epigraphy; the Qur’ān itself; and the biographical literature.  The poetry evokes the world the Qur’ān rejected: hunters, warriors and lovers, with no thought of an afterlife.  The material evidence, thanks to Saudi Arabia’s recent, cautious opening to archaeology, is transforming our picture of pre-Islamic politics and religion.  The Qur’ān turns a vastly varied scene into a single Muslim narrative, while preserving echoes of dialogue with Jews and Christians.  The biographical and historical narratives are copious for Muhammad, less so for his rivals.Module objectives: Participants in the seminar will consider (1) the evolution and adequacy of the instrumenta studiorum and the modern bibliography; (2) how to deduce historical narrative from sparse and disparate sources requiring various disciplines for their analysis; (3) how socio-historical contexts impact the formulation of religious teachings; (4) how scriptures and their exegetes promote their uniqueness by (re)constructing historical narratives.Specimen Seminars1: ‘Poets wandering in every valley, saying that which they do not’: The Qur’ān and poetryWhat can pre-Islamic poetry tell us about the socio-cultural environment of Arabia, and the jāhilīya mindset which the Qur’ān attacks?  How were the texts transmitted, and they be dated?2: ‘You hew the mountains into houses’: Architecture, art and epigraphyWhy does the Qur’ān so frequently refer to monuments of times past?  Is archaeology able to elucidate these references?  Can epigraphy help us understand the Qur’ānic text?  What picture of pre-Islamic Arabian religion and politics emerges from the material evidence?3: History from the Qur’ān?What didactic use does the Qur’ān make of precedent/exemplum from history?  Can the scripture also be seen as an historical source?  Does the Qur’ān’s engagement with Judaism and Christianity reflect the situation in 6th-/early -7th c. Arabia?4: Prophetic biographies: Muhammad, Musaylima and othersWhat is the value of Ibn Ishāq’s Life of the Prophet as a source for pre-Islamic Arabia, given its teleological Muslim narrative?  Why was Ibn Ishāq’s pre-Islamic narrative so truncated by his editor Ibn Hishām, and what contribution did his Life make to Tabarī’s eventual historical synthesis?  What evidence is there for other prophets in Muhummad’s Arabia, and how has it been treated?Description of assessmentThere will be four ninety minute seminars.  Students will be required to write an essay of not more than 5,000 words and a seminar presentation of 1,000 words.Suggested Essay TitlesEssay titles must be agreed with the course coordinator and subsequently by the degree committee.Does ‘pre-Islamic’ poetry anticipate, or explain, or even (given the process of its transmission) reflect the Qur’anic world view?How has study of Arabian epigraphy changed our understanding of the religious context of sixth- and seventh-century Arabia?Consider the symbolism of built structures in pre-Islamic poetry and the Qur’ān.What is the evidence for ‘Judeo-monotheism’ and Judaism in pre-Islamic Arabia?Account for the divergences between the Qur’ān’s perception of Christianity and that which we derive from our Greek and Syriac sources.Compare the involvement in pre-Islamic Arabia of the three neighbouring empires: Iran, Aksum and East Rome.‘Classical Arabic historians and contemporary Wahhabi ideologues have similar reasons for cultivating the impression of an empty pre-Islamic Hijāz.’  Discuss.© 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

I can choose to study scripture, history, literature, anthropology, languages, philosophy or ethics.Not only can you study these disciplines in their own modules, but often you can find ways of coming at questions that incorporate other subjects or disciplines, in order to form an original and interesting response." Caspar, first year studentOur undergraduate degree is structured to allow you the choice to sample all aspects of the Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion* programme or to select tracks which focus on particular elements of our teaching. You will develop a variety of skills by covering a broad range of intellectual pursuits including the study of scripture, critical analysis of the works of great thinkers, the history of particular periods of human civilisation and reflecting on the latest scientific theories.The course allows you the freedom to choose from a range of religious traditions and allows you to pursue multiple interests from an historical, philosophical or comparative perspective. You can combine an interest in Religion with History, Sociology, Philosophy, Literature, Politics, Psychology or Science. The decision will be yours and you are not bound to follow any particular path at any stage of the degree. Teaching is provided through lectures, classes and supervisions. You can expect up to nine hours of classes and lectures a week as well as a weekly supervision.Assessment is mainly by three-hour written examinations, but some papers are assessed on the basis of coursework essays.The course is broken down into three years of study:This is a foundation year and you will study five papers (modules).These will include a scriptural language, which is usually studied from scratch. This gives you a unique insights into the texts and will help you understand the impact of translation on understanding scripture. You can choose from Hebrew, New Testament Greek, Sanskrit or Qur'anic Arabic. Look at our Learning a Language page to find out more about what this involves.You'll also choose a Biblical paper. Textual analysis is a core part of your education in all fields of religion. By taking the Old or New Testament paper you will be well prepared for undertaking further study in any of the major world religions:In addition you choose three more papers from a choice of six:To get a grounding in these papers, have a look at the book titles listed on our page of Introductory reading. This year builds on the knowledge and skills acquired in your first year. You take four papers from 16, covering a wide choice so that you can tailor the course to your interests.   You could also take, as an additional paper, an Elementary Scriptural language – from Part I.Read descriptions of the papers available this year for Part IIA to find out more (you'll leave this section of the site and be directed to information for current undergraduates).All of the teaching is informed by the research of our lecturers and supervisors, but in the third year there is particular opportunity to study in topics that bear closely upon the cutting-edge current research  (either in the so-called ‘D’ papers, or through a dissertation). Read descriptions of the papers available this year for Part IIB to find out more (you'll leave this section of the site and be directed to information for current undergraduates).Some students prefer to follow a specific pathway that matches their interests for one or more years. You do not have to formally opt for one of these and if you specialise in one year, you are not bound to do so in subsequent years. However, some students find that it helps guide their choices, given the range of option on offer.Possible tracks include:Download a document to see how you could follow one of the tracks by combining papers that were on offer in 2014-15 *The new title will apply to all students applying in 2016 and starting the course on or after 1 October 2017. Candidates starting the course prior to that date will continue to take papers under the title of Theological and Religious Studies. The course content will remain similar.© 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

My thesis begins with an initial framework, with the identification of these claims, and a sketch of the background from which the authors’ statements emerged (eg. which traditions or texts are they drawing upon). I will then examine the six claims about Scriptural Reasoning through the lens of the Islamic tradition. I am looking at the claims in light of the history of Muslim attitudes towards/relationships with Jews and Christians and with the scriptures of Jews and Christians. I am exploring questions such as: Is there theological support for these claims? Is there anything theologically at stake with these claims? For historical responses to these questions, I will look to the Qur’an, classical and modern tafsīr, hadīth, and supporting secondary literature. For contemporary responses to these questions, I will look to contemporary scholarship and I will conduct anthropological fieldwork. The fieldwork takes place in Scriptural Reasoning groups, Qur'anic study circles, and hadith study circles in Blackburn, UK.The goal of my research is to construct a dialogue between voices of Scriptural Reasoning and voices from the Islamic tradition. I will propose how the claims might be qualified, revised, or reaffirmed in light of this dialogue, considering possible implications and responses. I will also address other audiences, scholars of interfaith dialogue and Islam/interfaith relations, offering to them insight into possible ways of thinking about language used—and the potential implications of such language—in descriptions of other types of interfaith dialogue, and demonstrating one practical way of examining that language.Jospeh Soloveitchik and Inter-faith DialogueFriendship with non-Muslims: a critical analysis of the views of pre-modern and modern Qur'anic exegeticsThe Understanding of Speech and Language in the Thought of Rabbi Shalom Dovber SchneersonA Conceptual Analysis of Possible Reconciliations and Integrations of Evolutionary and Islamic ThoughtFunctional Hermeneutics: Articulating the Moral Significance of Qur'anic NarrativesEthnographic Study of a Christian Ashram in IndiaThe Ontology of the Beatific Vision in the Classical Ash'arī School Who is the 'Guru'?  A Theological Study of the Religious Leader in a Swaminarayan SectIbn Sina's Philosophy of MathematicsSuhrawardī's Illuminationist Philosophy© 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

Studying theology and religion here allows you to engage a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, anthropology, history, literature, the study of the Bible and the Qur'an – and much else besides.I hope you will visit us to learn more about all we have to offer for your university degree.

Our two major graduate degree programmes are the MPhil and the PhD. The MPhil is a one year taught master's degree, including a dissertation. The PhD is a three year research degree, which is also offered part-time over five years.There are 22 University Teaching Officers, covering six core areas: Christian Theology, History of Christianity, New Testament, Old Testament, Philosophy of Religion and Religious Studies. Information about academics and subject areas can be found under 'People' and 'Subjects' on the main site menu.In addition, there are many other researchers across the university and colleges, including senior tutors, deans of chapel, and masters of colleges, who are affiliated to the faculty and contribute to its life. The faculty also enjoys a regular stream of visiting academics from around the world staying from anywhere between a few weeks to more than a year.The faculty’s research culture is focused around the senior seminar, which meet regularly during term time. Here, academics from Cambridge and elsewhere read and discuss papers. There are nine senior seminars, covering the six subject areas listed above, plus Hebrew, Jewish and Early Christian Studies, Patristics and World Christianity. More information about the senior seminars can be found under the 'Subjects' section of the main menu.Alongside these seminars there is also a wide range of informal reading groups. A list can be found under the 'Research' section of the main menu. The faculty also has a number of endowed lectures which see leading academics visiting the faculty. Again a list can be found in the Research' pages. The Faculty's distinctive modern building has excellent facilities for research students: a common room for staff and graduate students, an enclosed garden, and a large library housing a rich collection of printed material on two floors (in addition to the growing number of online databases and electronic journals).The University of Cambridge is one of the leading universities in the world and it has many researchers outside of the Faculty of Divinity who work on religious and theological issues. There are well-established relationships with the faculties of History, Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, Classics, History and Philosophy of Science, Philosophy, and Archaeology and Anthropology.  A major focus for interdisciplinary work is the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRAASH). CRAASH is located in an adjacent building and organizes over 400 events a year. Various groups have been established across faculty boundaries to promote interdisciplinary research. Some of the groups with which the Faculty has particular interest are the Cambridge Forum for Jewish Studies, the Cambridge Late Antiquity Network, the Cambridge Project in Modern Jewish Thought and the Locating Religion Research Group.The University has exceptional research collections. The nearby University Library (UL) has more than eight million print items and numerous unique archives. One of the most important is the Taylor-Schechter Genizah collection, over 140,000 manuscripts and fragments from the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Cairo. The UL also includes the library of the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Acton Library, which specializes in ecclesiastical history since the Reformation. It also has in its possession the Codex Bezae Cantabrigienis, a unique fifth century codex of the New Testament. The colleges each have their own collections and archives, often housing manuscripts of national and international importance. The Parker Library at Corpus Christi College has an outstanding collection of rare books and manuscripts including the sixth century Gospels, given by St Gregory the Great to St Augustine of Canterbury when he was sent to England. The library of Tyndale House contains a collection of relating to contemporary Biblical Studies of international renown.The strengths of Cambridge as an environment for theological research are not limited to the university. There are a number of other institutions based in Cambridge, many of which have strong relationships with the faculty. The Cambridge Theological Federation consists of seven institutions that deliver theological education: Ridley Hall, Westcott House, Westminster College, the Institute for Orthodox Christian Studies, the Margaret Beaufort Institute for Theology, Wesley House, and the Eastern Region Ministry Course. There are also a number of specialist research centres, including the Cambridge Centre for Christianity Worldwide, Tyndale House, the Faraday Institute for Science and Religion, and the Woolf Institute for Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations. The Faculty’s own Cambridge Inter-Faith Programme plays a leading national and international role in fostering and deepening Jewish-Christian-Muslim relations.Please visit our Graduate Applications page for details on how to apply for any of our graduate courses.© 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

Many of our graduate students are self-funded or supported by external sponsors. But the Faculty does have a range of scholarships and bursaries available to support the fees and maintenance costs of graduate students, and also submits candidates in the various funding competitions within the University of Cambridge (Gates Cambridge, AHRC Doctoral Training Partnership, and Cambridge Trust).Funding opportunities are limited in number and highly competitive, but all applicants offered a place will be considered by the Faculty’s Studentships Committee for any Faculty awards or University funding competitions for which they are eligible, unless they have explicitly indicated on their application form that they do not wish to be considered. (However, please note that eligibility for Gates Cambridge awards depends on explicit application subject to special deadlines.) The deliberations and recommendations of the Faculty’s Studentships Committee will be based solely on academic considerations (academic record and references, assessment of submitted written work, and quality and feasibility of research proposal where relevant).The following are among the studentships offered from time to time as resources permit:The Faculty Studentships Committee also nominates candidates for the following University funding competitions (for further details follow the links below):Please note that studentships or competitions are not open to those who have already started their course of graduate study at Cambridge except for those marked above with an asterisk.If you wish to apply for AHRC funding please fill in the form on the Graduate Admissions' website.  Please take note of the following instructions:Applicants applying for admission should complete this form and load it onto their CamSIS application.Current M.Phil. students applying to the Ph.D. should complete this form and load it onto their CamSIS application to continue.Current Ph.D. students should complete this form and send it to the Scholarships Administrator. Westminster College, Cambridge: Lewis and Gibson ScholarshipMrs Margaret Dunlop Gibson (died 1920) and Mrs Agnes Smith Lewis (died 1926) bequeathed funds to establish Lewis and Gibson Scholarships at Westminster College, Cambridge. The funds presently realise (in 2014) about £7,300 per annum, and this income is administered by a Board of Electors under the authority of the College Governors and the General Assembly of the United Reformed Church.The main terms and conditions of this scholarship include the following:1. The scholar must be a member of the United Reformed Church, or of a member-church of the World Communion of Reformed Churches which holds Presbyterian order and is not established by the state.2. The scholar should have been recognised by his or her church as a candidate for the ministry, but should not yet have been ordained.3. The scholar is normally expected to be a graduate of a recognised university.4. The scholar is required to reside in Cambridge, and to be a member of Westminster College.5. The scholar is required to study for a degree or diploma (normally a degree) of Cambridge University. The Electors wish to encourage applications for the taught M.Phil. in theology, or from a doctoral student. The scholar must go through the University's own admission procedures: holding the scholarship does not guarantee admission; separate negotiations are needed.6. The Electors are required to award the scholarship on merit.The Electors now invite applications for the scholarship for the academic year 2015-16. The Electors are currently reviewing the terms and use of the scholarship, and so cannot guarantee extending this award beyond one year.Applications for the scholarship in 2016-17 should be made as soon as possible, and at the latest before Christmas 2015.

The Gates box and reference are the only places where you can demonstrate your service for others and leadership. There is no need to make a further case for your intellectual qualities.Failing to detail the nature of service or leadership. Assessors view significant quantitative information about your academic study: academic grades, professors’ assessment of how students compare to their cohort, degrees studied, languages learnt and to what level. Similar detail should be given about service and leadership. What did you do? How did it make a difference? How many years did you undertake the role? How many people were in the team you led?Assuming knowledge on the part of the assessors. Applicants often enumerate service and leadership in just a single sentence, and so fail to provide the detail that is needed and assume assessors will understand the service undertaken. Theologians and RS scholars often fail to describe what leadership and service can be seen in a mission trip, being a minister of religion or Sunday school teaching.Choosing a referee who comments on academic ability only. Two academic references are required for any application for postgraduate study in Cambridge. The Gates reference needs to specifically address leadership potential and commitment to improving the lives of others.Writing an aspirational statement about future leadership or service. Commitment to others and leadership potential are demonstrated through past activities, however modest.Having a narrow sense of what leadership and commitment to the lives of others means. Starting an international charity and managing a team of thirty people are not the only means of demonstrating leadership and service. In addition, note that ‘others’ has not been restricted to human beings.You will be considered for funding when you are offered a place on the M.Phil. or Ph.D. degreesFunding decisions are taken on the basis of an assessment of academic ability and research potential, examination results, references and interview but also consideration is given to the suitability of your proposed topic within the Faculty’s research priorities and the availability of expert supervisors.Apply to the Faculty's MPhil in Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion to take the Christian Theology stream for 2018/2019.  The maximum possible value of a Barnard Randolph Studentship for the academic year 2018-19 would be £10,800 (the course fee at the Home/EU rate).Applying or taking the M.Phil. or Ph.D. degree in the Philosophy of Religion field.  The studentship is for one year but may be given for one further year subject to satisfactory progress.  The maximum amount is £13,000.Current Students should send your current CV and two academic references to Dr Peter Haland by 13 February 2018.Applicants should fill in the funding box on the application form saying that you want to be considered for Burney funding.Apply to the Faculty's MPhil in Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion to do any area of Theology for 2018/2019.

The funds presently realise (in 2017) about £7,500 per annum, and this income is administered by a Board of Electors under the authority of the College Governors and the General Assembly of the United Reformed Church.The main terms and conditions of this scholarship include the following:The Electors now invite applications for the scholarship for the academic year 2018-19. The Electors review the use of the scholarship each year, and so it may be renewed for the same applicant, but this cannot be guaranteed.Applications for the scholarship in 2018-19 should be made at the latest before 30 June 2018 (for October 2018 start) or before 31 December 2018 (for January 2019 start). Please send a brief note of enquiry to the address/email below, and you will be advised how to apply formally.Contact Address for Enquiry or Application:Dr Alison GrayDirector of StudiesWestminster CollegeMadingley RoadCambridge CB3 0AAEnglandarh26@cam.ac.uk Notes on finance and accommodationStudents coming to Cambridge University will need funds to cover the following: (i) university Composition Fee; (ii) university college fee; (iii) maintenance and living costs. The income of the scholarship therefore cannot cover the full academic and living expenses of a graduate student. The student would need to have substantial financial support from elsewhere. Cambridge graduate students are not allowed to combine fulltime study with a part-time job.A student who came to Cambridge alone would be welcome to apply for a room in the Westminster College residential block, and we also have a few flats that are suitable for a couple. Family accommodation can be more difficult to arrange and quite expensive.© 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

Today, working in partnership with the theological colleges and institutes of the Cambridge Theological Federation, the Faculty of Divinity provides a Bachelor of Theology for Ministry (BTh) degree and an Advanced Diploma in Theology for Ministry.Admission to these vocational awards is at the discretion of the BTh Management Committee, which reviews all applications on behalf of the Faculty Board. In the first instance, all enquiries and applications should be made to one of the following training institutions:The Bachelor of Theology for Ministry (BTh) is a two year vocational degree. The course is divided into the First Examination and Second Examination years. Entry to the First Examination year is possible for those candidates who have satisfactorily completed study equivalent to 120 credits at Level 4 (Certificate Level) or who have a good first degree. The regulations require that candidates must complete a pastoral portfolio to the satisfaction of the examiners in order to proceed to the degree.The requirement of constant, intentional integration of pastoral activity, self-awareness and academic study makes it an intense experience and a good preparation for public ministry.As well as attendance at lectures and seminars, the BTh offers a particular emphasis on small-group teaching and regular supervision.The Advanced Diploma in Theology for Ministry (DTM) is a graduate entry programme designed primarily for candidates preparing for authorised Christian ministry or service. The DTM may be studied full-time in a single year or part-time over two years. Candidates are required to take five papers (or their equivalent).

The scope and content of the course are the same as those of the full-time one-year MPhil programme, with the taught elements of the course constituting the first year and the dissertation element the second year. The total fees for the part-time route are the same as for the full-time route, but are payable in smaller instalments over the two years.Although it must be emphasised that the part-time route is not envisaged as a ‘distance-learning’ programme, part-time candidates are exempt from the University of Cambridge’s residence requirements (which apply to students engaged in full-time programmes here). But students must be able to travel to and from Cambridge conveniently in term-time in order to attend the necessary seminars and supervisions. The part-time route is not an online programme, and seminars are not available via video-conferencing. Part-time students are required to attend the same seminars and classes as full-time students, and need to have sufficient flexibility in their personal schedules to permit this. It is not possible for the Faculty to reschedule or duplicate provision especially for part-time students. The part-time route is designed to make the MPhil programme more accessible to some of those whose career or personal commitments make it impossible for them to consider full-time study.Compared to full-time students residing in or near Cambridge, part-time students may find that they are less able to take advantage of the optional supplementary academic activities and extracurricular activities that are offered in the Faculty, in the School of Arts and Humanities, in the Colleges, and in the University in general. Part-time students are of course fully welcome to participate in such activities and are encouraged to do so, although it must be emphasised that participation in supplementary academic activities is not a requirement of the course. It is particularly recommended that, if possible, part-time students attend whichever of the Faculty’s advanced research seminars is most relevant to their programme of study. Likewise, part-time students will have less ready access to the library resources of Cambridge, though they have the same access and borrowing rights as full-time students. On the positive side, part-time students may find that they have longer to design their dissertation research proposal.As part of the application process, students may apply for membership of a specific College (although this part of the form may be left open: ‘open’ applications are distributed among Colleges by a function of the application system). In choosing a College, applicants for the part-time route might wish to consider the merits of Colleges which do, or do not, specialise in graduate students or mature students, and might also wish to enquire of particular Colleges as to whether they have many part-time graduate students. It should be emphasised that applicants who are offered a place at the University are not necessarily offered a place at their College of first choice.Students from outside the United Kingdom who would require a Tier 4 visa in order to come to Cambridge to study should note that students proposing to study part-time are not eligible for Tier 4 visas. Only an offer of a place to study in the UK full-time can be grounds for a Tier 4 visa.Students from the European Union are still able to travel freely to the UK without a visa, and are therefore eligible to apply for the part-time route in this MPhil.                                                                                                                 © 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

Studying theology and religion here allows you to engage a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, anthropology, history, literature, the study of the Bible and the Qur'an – and much else besides.I hope you will visit us to learn more about all we have to offer for your university degree. Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions about studying here.Ian A.

You won't regret being in this incredible place reading one of the most diverse and interesting degrees Cambridge offers - a truly interdisciplinary subject which allows you, whatever your perspective, to develop crucial skills for the future."Dominic, third-year studentThe ApplicationYour application will be made via the UCAS form, and includes details of your current subjects and grades, teachers' references, and a personal statement. It is worth remembering that the closing date for applications to Oxford and Cambridge is on 15 October, earlier than for other Universities. Don't leave it too late!All applications for undergraduate degrees are handled by the individual colleges that make up the University of Cambridge. The University has an excellent admissions website which will guide you through the process. We welcome students from all over the world. If you are an international applicant, please refer to the relevant pages on the Cambridge Admissions website.Many applicants worry a great deal over whether they have chosen the 'right' College for their application. The admissions process for Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion is designed to ensure that it really does not matter which College you apply to: strong candidates will have a good chance of gaining a place at one of the Colleges in the University.When making decisions about who to admit, we will take into account all of the information on the UCAS form as well as your interview, the quality of any essays which you submit in advance, and your performance in the at-interview assessment. More details about all of these elements can be found below.Entry requirementsNo particular subjects at A level (or equivalent) are required for Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion and it is not necessary to have studied Religious Studies at AS or A level. Subjects such as Religious Studies, History, English and modern languages can be helpful, but so can any other subjects that encourage clear, logical thinking and careful analysis of evidence. Students with a completely science background study for the degree and do very well. We have some student profiles to show you some of the different combinations our students have studied. If you aren't studying religion at the moment, you may wish to supplement your knowledge of the area by reading an appropriate text: you may like to browse the introductory reading lists for new students.Some colleges may require you to have studied an essay-based subject. Please check individual college webpages for this information.Our entry requirements are A*AA at A-level or 40-41 points with 776 at Higher Level for IB; more information is available on the University's Undergraduate Study pages. No personal faith is required or assumed. We are looking for interest, engagement, and a demonstrable belief that Religion (for better or worse) is important in the world. "Although applying can seem daunting, I enjoyed narrowing down my preferences and really focusing on the reasons why I am interested in what I am interested in. The interview was great fun as well - although it is a scary prospect, those twenty minutes fly by and are a really great opportunity to talk about what you are passionate about."Hannah, first year studentAt-interview assessment exerciseIf you are invited to interview (about 80% of applicants) you will take part in a 60 minute assessment exercise when you come to Cambridge in December.It will take the form of a pre-recorded sample lecture. This will give you an opportunity to demonstrate how you have developed academically since you took your GCSEs. It will be skills-based, looking at your comprehension and writing skills, but will not assume any prior knowledge. It is worth remembering that this exercise is only one element in a large range of different types of information which are used to make an admission decision.The purpose is to determine a candidate’s potential to achieve in an academically demanding undergraduate degree course. The assessment is designed to be challenging, in order to differentiate effectively between able applicants, including those who may have achieved the highest grades in school examinations. The exercise will take one hour and consists of two sections:Section 1Candidates will watch a brief video of a sample lecture in the Faculty of Divinity on a subject related to religion. Candidates will be expected to make notes during this.Section 1 will last for approximately 20 minutes.Section 2Candidates will provide written answers to a series of comprehension questions about the content of the video. Marks are not deducted for incorrect answers, so candidates are advised to answer all questions. It will be skills based and no prior knowledge of any particular religion will be assumed. The purpose of this exercise is to allow the candidates to show recall, comprehension and analytical skills in respect to a lecture.Section two will last for approximately 40 minutes.We have three sample lectures available for you to familiarise yourself with the exercise and to practise your comprehension and recall skills:School EssaysApplicants to the following Colleges are also required to submit one or two School/college essays as examples of written work prior to interview. See individual College websites for further details.Interviews80% of applicants are interviewed here in Cambridge. If you are travelling to Cambridge, you will be offered accommodation during the interview period, which is usually one or two days long, and always takes place in December.The Faculty has an Admissions Co-ordinator who will receive a copy of every application for Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion across the Colleges. Before the interviewing begins, all of the Colleges meet to consider the whole field of applicants. At that meeting, each candidate is assigned an interview at a second College - this process not only compensates for peaks and troughs in applications to particular Colleges but also gives you a second chance, with a different interviewer, who may draw out a different response. To see a mock interview, see the Interviews in Action page.Applicants are interviewed in all Colleges on the same two days. Immediately afterwards the Directors of Studies meet again to compare notes; at this point they flag up to colleagues strong applicants for whom they might not have room at their College, but who deserve a place at another College. The Second Interview Scheme has proved to be very successful: over the last few years one offer in four has been made in this way.OutcomesStrong applicants who have not been made an offer by their first choice College are placed in the 'Pool'. You might then be made an offer by your second interview College, or by another College which is happy to rely on the information already available. It is possible that a third College might ask you to a further interview in January.  © 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

I've got no qualms about the usefulness of the degree".Lord Tim Clement-Jones, DLA Piper, an international law firmTheology and Religious Studies graduates are highly employable, offering multidisciplinary and inter-disciplinary skills, and detailed knowledge of diverse world views and issues.  “I'm not sure [what I want to do] at this stage but the time management skills, work ethic and ability to gather and analyse difficult evidence that I've gained will be invaluable.”AgnesYou will develop a range of transferable skills highly valued by employers. This means that our graduates go on to an extremely broad range of jobs and options in further education.Some of our graduates make direct use of the course content. We live in increasingly multi-cultural and multi-religious societies. This means that an understanding of the ways that different religious communities can work together and how organisations can have a successful relationship with clients from these backgrounds is very attractive to employers.Our Theology and Religious Studies degree also covers elements from other valuable disciplines such as history, languages, philosophy, anthropology, politics and sociology, meaning that you will leave university with a grounding in a broad range of subjects. In an increasingly global economy, the skills of vision, creativity and religious sensitivity, which are developed through the study of Theology and Religious Studies, will be at a premium.Other graduates apply the transferable skills that they have developed here to gain employment in or to study another area. Through studying Theology and Religious Studies at Cambridge you can:“I hope to do either conflict resolution or international aid/ development work and use the Arabic I have learnt here. The degree has greatly improved my self-discipline, confidence to pursue my ambitions and developed my linguistic and essay writing skills.”AnnaOur course inspires a significant proportion of our students to undertake options in further education after their three years of study. Over the last five years we have had an average of 39% of our graduates going on to study masters and research degrees in Theology and Religious Studies or related disciplines, teacher training and law.Theology and Religious Studies graduates from the University of Cambridge are particularly employable. Over the last five years we have had consistently high levels of occupation for our graduates, with an average of 93% entering employment or going on to further education within six months of graduating.

I can choose to study scripture, history, literature, anthropology, languages, philosophy or ethics.Not only can you study these disciplines in their own modules, but often you can find ways of coming at questions that incorporate other subjects or disciplines, in order to form an original and interesting response." Caspar, first year studentOur undergraduate degree is structured to allow you the choice to sample all aspects of the Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion* programme or to select tracks which focus on particular elements of our teaching. You will develop a variety of skills by covering a broad range of intellectual pursuits including the study of scripture, critical analysis of the works of great thinkers, the history of particular periods of human civilisation and reflecting on the latest scientific theories.The course allows you the freedom to choose from a range of religious traditions and allows you to pursue multiple interests from an historical, philosophical or comparative perspective. You can combine an interest in Religion with History, Sociology, Philosophy, Literature, Politics, Psychology or Science. The decision will be yours and you are not bound to follow any particular path at any stage of the degree. Teaching is provided through lectures, classes and supervisions. You can expect up to nine hours of classes and lectures a week as well as a weekly supervision.Assessment is mainly by three-hour written examinations, but some papers are assessed on the basis of coursework essays.The course is broken down into three years of study:This is a foundation year and you will study five papers (modules).These will include a scriptural language, which is usually studied from scratch. This gives you a unique insights into the texts and will help you understand the impact of translation on understanding scripture. You can choose from Hebrew, New Testament Greek, Sanskrit or Qur'anic Arabic. Look at our Learning a Language page to find out more about what this involves.You'll also choose a Biblical paper. Textual analysis is a core part of your education in all fields of religion. By taking the Old or New Testament paper you will be well prepared for undertaking further study in any of the major world religions:In addition you choose three more papers from a choice of six:To get a grounding in these papers, have a look at the book titles listed on our page of Introductory reading. This year builds on the knowledge and skills acquired in your first year. You take four papers from 16, covering a wide choice so that you can tailor the course to your interests.   You could also take, as an additional paper, an Elementary Scriptural language – from Part I.Read descriptions of the papers available this year for Part IIA to find out more (you'll leave this section of the site and be directed to information for current undergraduates).All of the teaching is informed by the research of our lecturers and supervisors, but in the third year there is particular opportunity to study in topics that bear closely upon the cutting-edge current research  (either in the so-called ‘D’ papers, or through a dissertation). Read descriptions of the papers available this year for Part IIB to find out more (you'll leave this section of the site and be directed to information for current undergraduates).Some students prefer to follow a specific pathway that matches their interests for one or more years. You do not have to formally opt for one of these and if you specialise in one year, you are not bound to do so in subsequent years. However, some students find that it helps guide their choices, given the range of option on offer.Possible tracks include:Download a document to see how you could follow one of the tracks by combining papers that were on offer in 2014-15 *The new title will apply to all students applying in 2016 and starting the course on or after 1 October 2017. Candidates starting the course prior to that date will continue to take papers under the title of Theological and Religious Studies. The course content will remain similar.© 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

The teaching is great and the staff have made this, easily, my favourite module.""Absolutely great – I have loved this course and it has been great fun learning this language and it is a valuable skill.""Lectures/classes have taken into account different levels of grammatical knowledge and gone at an appropriate pace – taking time for everyone to understand.""I thought I would find Greek quite hard, but the staff are making the subject very accessible and I am greatly enjoying it. Thank you – looking forward to next term."Anonymous student feedback forms, 2014-15 In your first year you will select five modules (papers) to study. One of these will be a scriptural language. This will give you foundational skills that you will need throughout your course of study.As the languages are new to the majority of undergraduates, we are often asked lots of questions about studying them at Cambridge. We hope that the answers below are helpful and you may also wish to read the more detailed information found at www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/data/PartI.pdf If you have a question that isn't answered here, please get in touch with our Outreach Officer, Laura Jeffrey, outreach@divinity.cam.ac.ukMore information about the other papers you can choose from in your first year (Part I) is available at www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/outreach/whatDeveloping a knowledge of a scriptural language will give you a deeper understanding of the religion it relates to and will support your study in that area. Additionally, you’ll become aware of the impact of translations on studies of scripture. By reading some of the original language, you will be able to comment on different versions of a text and reflect on the impact they may have on our understanding of the religion.You do not need to achieve certain grades in modern or classical languages at A-level or GCSE to apply to study Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion at Cambridge.  In fact, a good proportion of students have not formally studied any language beyond the age of 14.  All our classes are therefore designed to cater for complete beginners.The teaching of scriptural languages is of an excellent standard at Cambridge. Staff are supportive and attentive to the differing needs of students. You will be in small groups that meet regularly during term. This will enable you to become familiar with terms and concepts quickly. You’ll make satisfying progress so that you feel comfortable with the language well before the exams at the end of the year.You select one language from Hebrew, New Testament Greek, Qur'anic Arabic or Sanskrit. These relate to the core religions taught in the Faculty, respectively Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism and Buddhism.The scriptural languages are taught in the written form. The emphasis is on learning the grammar and vocabulary you need to be able to start reading the language. Therefore most of your work will be reading and writing in the language. You will of course learn pronunciation in class, but there is no assessed oral component.Most students are new to the language they will be learning and so no prior experience is assumed. However, if you choose to learn New Testament Greek, an online course is available to introduce you to key concepts before you arrive in Cambridge www.greek.divinity.cam.ac.uk.Although not aimed at students new to the language, if you are interested in studying Hebrew, you may wish to look at the Artefacts of Ancient Judaism website to give you a flavour of what understanding a language will enable you to do http://artefacts.lib.cam.ac.uk/index.html There are three classes a week, lasting between one and one and half hours. Some students will have a greater aptitude for language learning and be more familiar with grammatical concepts. Where numbers permit, students may be grouped into different classes to help support their language learning.In addition, students receive a number of supervisions during the year and revision classes in the before exams.Our students study a small section of each text; you’ll be very familiar with it by the end of the year. Details of the specific texts covered are available at www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/data/PartI.pdfYou will be asked to translate passages from the scriptural language into English from prescribed text(s), comment on grammatical forms, and translate sentences from English into the scriptural language.Students are only required to study a scriptural language in their first year.Many students carry on with the language in the second year and some will continue into their third year. It is also possible to start a new language in your second or third year (at beginners’ level).© 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

Also, I already had some Classical Greek before I got to Cambridge and so wanted to try something different.Both teachers were lively, humorous, patient and experienced. That’s particularly important, since you see them three times a week – more than any other paper. Also, the classes tend to be small, meaning that there is more opportunity to work through individual points of confusion. The classes have to move quickly, and so it is really important that you consolidate what’s covered in your own time.For students, like me, who have studied languages before, Hebrew is an extremely rewarding language to study for a year – or more! I’ve kept it up in my second year. I began studying New Testament Greek with no prior experience of ancient languages, but after a year I can honestly say that it has been an invaluable undertaking. During my first week of Greek, I found learning the alphabet challenging and it seemed impossible that I would ever be able to read the texts. However, the classes we worked in and the guidance and encouragement I was given by teachers enabled me to progress in understanding grammar and vocabulary.I really enjoyed the set texts and the exam format as it allowed us to study some passages in depth, while also developing the skill of being able to translate an unseen passage and understand its meaning.  The Sanskrit paper is usually taught in a small class, as it is only a few who choose to study it as their scriptural language! This is a good thing, however, as it means close attention from the teacher. First year focuses on the study of Sanskrit grammar, of which there is a lot. Homework exercises after each class, as well as supervisions, ensures that the various rules and anomalies stick in your head.Once basic grammar has been grasped, you move on to the study of texts, mainly excerpts from the Bhagavad Gita and Mahabharata, as well as short stories from the Hitopadesa. It is really exciting to be able to transliterate and translate these texts from the original script, with the aid of your supervisor! The end of year examination then tests your knowledge of these translations and the grammar featured within them. Overall, studying such an unusual language is a highly rewarding experience. I really enjoyed Arabic; at first I was always a bit apprehensive about studying another language (I’d done French till AS level, but knew that a language at Cambridge would be an entirely different thing!) but it turned out to be one of the most enjoyable aspects of my course!Having always had both a personal and academic interest in the Middle East and Islamic culture, choosing to study Arabic has proven to be an excellent platform from which to better understand and engage with classical texts and appreciate the complexity of sacred narratives as they were first conveyed and passed on. For me, having the opportunity to study Arabic also provided a welcome break from the often monotonous routine of reading and writing weekly essays!  The Old Testament paper, focusing on David, really challenged the way I think about different passages of the Bible and how we interpret them. I particularly enjoyed considering the theological message about God’s character and action in the world, though I also found new aspects interesting, such as studying archaeology. The lectures for this course were clear and helpful, and I found the last four classes especially enjoyable and thought-provoking as our own involvement in discussion was encouraged. The exam required me to recognise the literary, theological and historical aspects of the texts, and the supervision essays were helpful for approaching unseen questions. Christianity and the Transformation of Culture, the church history paper, was the most content-heavy course. Anyone who did history at A-Level will be familiar with what’s on offer, even if they have no background knowledge about the English Reformation. It’s about how a religious culture in its entirety – not just ‘religion’, but politics, society, art – is radically re-oriented in a matter of decades. It therefore helps if you have some grip in advance on the main theological differences between Catholics and Protestants.The lectures and seminars for this course were excellent. I took away something valuable each time. Not only that, but this paper succeeds in bridging the gap between ‘theology’ and ‘religious studies’, since you not only examine 16th English culture ‘from the outside’ (R.S.), but also look into what theologians, clergy and politicians were saying about the transformation of their own society (theology).I came to Cambridge with a particular interest in dogmatic and systematic theology, so I chose the introductory course to Christian doctrine as a way to bring some of my own interests into the course.I think it’s an effective introduction to the broader tradition of Christian theology. All mainstream confessions are represented – Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican. While this eclecticism makes the paper seem quite fragmented – the variety is appealing. No other paper covers two millennia of reflection on a one single question: this paper does. And, if you are already familiar with the basic questions of Christian theology there is always the possibility to incorporate your own reading into your essays, and supervisors encourage creativity.If you’re interested in history, sociology, literature, anthropology and just a bit of everything – this paper is definitely for you! At the risk of sounding clichéd, it took me into territories I had never explored before – and had never really associated with the study of theology. Topics like Colonialism, the influence of the Media, the role of women and the rise of religious fundamentalism are as topical as they are engaging.For me, the paper really opened my eyes to the subtle nuances in the ways religious identities are conceived and practiced, and I genuinely believe that approaching religion from these diverse angles has made me much more open-minded and inquisitive when considering issues I formerly took to be fairly straight-forward! After the foundational elements of the first year, you have a very wide choice of papers to choose from in your second and third years.As well as studying languages at a more advanced level you experience a wide variety of topics including Judaism in the Greek and Roman periods, the Letters of Paul, World Christianities, Religious Themes in Literature, Introduction to Islam, Philosophy of Religion, Life and Thought of Religious Hinduism and Buddhism, the Johannine Tradition, Old Testament: Creation and Covenant, New Testament Christology, Theologies of Hope, Self and Salvation in Indian and Western Thought, The Rise of Pentecostalism, Contemporary Study of Religion, Jewish Law, Islamic Philosophy, Metaphysics, Theology, Science and Creatures, and Topics in Christian Ethics.You also have the choice of studying for a dissertation. Here, two students share their experiences of undertaking independent study. My dissertation focused on the motifs of divine presence and absence in one of the most unorthodox psalms in the Hebrew Bible – Psalm 88. In addition to a close exegetical reading of the psalm itself, my study branched out into the wider theological issues surrounding divine presence and activity in the world as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible. Ever since I started Tripos, I knew I wanted to write a dissertation, but the topic itself took time to crystallise into something concrete and tangible. By the final year of Tripos, I had accumulated a long list of avenues I had not had a chance to explore because I was so busy writing the next supervision essay – and then the next, and the next.Over the summer before the final year, I did a fair amount of wider reading and research that helped me clarify my interests. I chose my supervisor before I came up with the exact topic, and she suggested some reading to stimulate my thoughts and give me a broad overview of certain contemporary discussions which were of interest to me. Using these recommendations and my own interests and ideas as a springboard, I began to shape my topic. Even if you already have a topic you want to study in depth, you may have to refine it further to make it narrow and specific – in other words, it has to be practically feasible.In my experience, one of the most exciting things about writing a dissertation is working with your supervisor. I had an excellent supervisor who helped me sharpen not only my arguments, but also my research skills: After all, as well as some theological sparkle, a dissertation requires planning, discipline, commitment, and motivation. If I got stuck in my research, she expertly diagnosed the situation and helpfully pointed me in the right direction. In short, although a dissertation, at its heart, is an independent study project, you can expect advice and guidance, both theological and practical, from your supervisor, who wants you to succeed, and you are certainly not left wandering about in the dark.You do, however, have to be prepared for a lot of independent study. I enjoyed the research stage immensely, as I got to pursue my own interests and formulate my own arguments – I found the creative freedom of a dissertation exhilarating rather than intimidating. As you work on your dissertation, you essentially become a specialist in a particular area, however small it may be, and this is an extremely rewarding experience. After the thrill of the research stage comes the final leg of the journey: the writing-up stage. I enjoy writing, so it did not prove to be a hard slog, but it was certainly a long trek that required a lot of discipline, especially as it was mostly over the Easter vacation. I left footnotes and bibliography until the very end – a big mistake! On the bright side, after you submit at the beginning of the Easter term, you are done and do not have as many exams to worry about.During your third year, all Theology students are offered the opportunity to write a dissertation of up to 10,000 words, in place of a piece of coursework or exam paper. The choice of topic is at the writer’s discretion, and can cover any aspect of theology or religious studies. I was immediately attracted to the idea of researching and writing an original piece of work that covered themes not necessarily addressed by the Tripos.The teaching for a dissertation is slightly different to that of an exam or coursework module. The supervisor guides rather than governs the process, suggesting rather than directing the direction your work might take. Writing a dissertation allows the writer real agency throughout the process but with all the benefits of the guiding hand of an expert in the subject.In terms of timescale, a brief proposal is submitted in Michaelmas with the final title of the dissertation finalized mid-way through the Lent Term. This in itself allows for an evolution of thoughts and ideas. In planning and researching a dissertation, there is no prescribed reading list. As a result, source material is entirely fashioned by both writer and supervisor. In this way a multitude of resources can be used in research, and the fact that the student is not limited to academic texts is one of the dissertation’s prime advantages. In writing my dissertation, I made use of novels, newspapers, archival material and photography. This gives every dissertation an aspect of originality, and makes the process especially rewarding.After choosing to write an essay within the broad field of Church History, I focused my research on the religious landscape of Victorian Britain. My supervisor encouraged me to ground my research in a local area, with the result that I chose to study an area of Victorian Shoreditch, East London, once known as the Old Nichol. My thesis explored the impact of Christian activity on the people of this notorious slum, and the extent to which Victorian perceptions of religion and irreligion held true here. This period was one of huge social and political change, and a time of both huge activity and self-doubt on the part of all Christian denominations. The ‘Old Nichol’ proved a microcosm of these themes; the intersection of theology, sociology and historiography, examined through the life of this small place, was fascinating.I found the process of writing this thesis a hugely rewarding exercise, and one which marked a refreshing change from exam-orientated Tripos modules. The project did require a great deal of planning and research, but I had an excellent supervisor to nudge me in the right direction and offer invaluable advice when needed. This was an evolutionary process, with the end result little resembling what I initially envisaged; I very much enjoyed the process of crafting a narrative and a set of ideas which transformed and gained impetus throughout the year.I found researching and writing a dissertation a rewarding and stimulating part of my final year, and one I would highly recommend. It provides a unique opportunity in Part IIB to explore specific interests, producing an original piece of work and researching a subject in a way normally reserved for students at a higher level.© 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

Such tracks could include Philosophy and Ethics, Islamic Studies, Jewish Studies, Religious Traditions of India, Biblical Studies, History of Christianity or Christian Doctrine. From the outset this course prioritises choice in terms of subject areas and world religions and it is maintained throughout all three years. For more information about the options, see our page on 'What can I study?'.Our students consistently praise our teaching. In the 2015 National Student Survey, 93 per cent said that overall, they were satisfied with the quality of the course; 95 per cent agreed that the staff are good at explaining things, and 98 per cent felt that the course is intellectually stimulating. In addition to the modules you choose, you’ll also take our four-week Undergraduate Study Skills course to give you the best start to your degree.The supervision system is highly valued by our students. A supervision is a small-group teaching session. These are usually one hour in length with one to three students and a member teaching staff who is a specialist in the subject. They will come from across the colleges depending on which area of the course you are studying. That is why it doesn’t matter which college you go to – you’ll receive an excellent education wherever you are based.This dedicated time with an expert will develop your ideas, critical thinking, and writing skills. It is a great opportunity to explore the course material to a much greater depth than lectures allow. Different supervisors may structure supervisions in different ways and they are often tailored for the individual students concerned. By studying at Cambridge you’ll not only spend more time with teaching staff that at some other universities but it will be relevant to your needs to help you excel.You will usually be asked to prepare in some way for supervisions, by either submitting work beforehand or preparing other work to present. This work and the supervision are not formally assessed (they do not count towards the degree) and you are encouraged to use the time to explore new approaches to learning and topics outside of the lectures. You’ll receive regular reports from your supervisors and this feedback will ensure that you know where you’re making progress and what you need to do to improve.The international teaching staff include specialists in a variety of faith traditions and in the study of religion and religious practice. These world-class academics, along with students and researchers, comprise a supportive and enriching Faculty community. On weekdays we provide coffee for the whole Faculty to give you the opportunity to learn from peers and scholars in a relaxed setting.The award-winning Faculty building has lecture and seminar rooms and is fully equipped with state-of-the-art audio visual facilities. As a student here you will benefit from exceptional resources including access to Faculty, College and University libraries. These contain specialist texts and manuscripts including the Codex Bezae, an important early version of the Gospel, and the Genizah collection, a globally significant source for medieval Judaism. More information is available on our library web pages. *The new title will apply to all students applying in 2016 and starting the course on or after 1 October 2017. Candidates starting the course prior to that date will continue to take papers under the title of Theological and Religious Studies.© 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.

The Cambridge course suited me because I have interests in multiple subject areas and this degree was able to accommodate all of them.”Caspar, first year student Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion* is a rigorous and thought-provoking degree that cultivates skills from across the arts and humanities. Textual Analysis forms the core of the degree. You will evaluate historic and contemporary texts in the form of scripture, literature, historical sources, philosophical treatises and academic debates.  You will learn how to critique the material and form well-developed and reasoned arguments in both verbal and written forms.Religion is playing an increasingly important role in state politics, international relations, and social actions. The fostering of religious understanding has immense implications for individual, national and international well-being. By developing your knowledge of religions you will take valuable skills into whatever career you choose.Whether your focus is an individual search for meaning, or fundamental issues of war and peace, freedom and bondage, good and evil, this degree is about the relentless pursuit of a deeper, truer understanding. You do not have to be religious to study for this degree: our undergraduates belong to all religions and none. What you do need is a passion for the importance of religion in the world and by studying it you have the opportunity to develop your thinking in this area and express your views. See some student profiles below that demonstrate that there is no typical Theology student.Religion intersects with numerous other disciplines across the academic spectrum. You can combine an interest in religion with History, Sociology, Philosophy, Literature, Politics, Psychology or Science. There is no typical Theology student. Our students come from diverse backgrounds. Some are religious, others have no personal faith. They come from a range of schools across the UK and further afield. Our students have studied a range of subjects at school or college. Here, some of them explain why they chose to study Theology at Cambridge: NIAMH studied English Literature, Music, and History at A-level and German at AS-levelBefore coming to Cambridge, I had never studied any Theology or Religious Studies. I had grown up going to Church, but I had never really realized that studying Theology at university was an option until the summer before I applied. I was originally going to apply for English or History, and it was my parents who suggested I look at the Cambridge Theology degree. The course was so flexible and I would have the option of studying religion, such a massive part of not only my own life but also of world history and culture, from a variety of different standpoints, drawing on the subjects I had loved so much at school: literature, history, languages, sociology, philosophy, just to name a few. I went to some taster days and study schools and became really interested in some of the theologians we learnt about there, and began to do my own reading around the subject. Throughout my time at Cambridge and the amazingly diverse course offered here I have been able to tailor my paper choices to the areas of Theology I am most interested in, including New Testament Greek, Christian Theology, and a dissertation focusing on religious themes in literature. I am so glad I decided to study Theology and Religious Studies; not only have I developed a wealth of different skills but I have begun to delve into a field that will continue to interest me and affect my life long after my degree has finished. PETER studied Maths, Economics, Politics and Religious Studies at A-levelI chose to read Theology, Religion and the Philosophy of Religion at Cambridge simply because I love the subject. Being able to delve into familiar material that I have held as truth, in a new way, and look at critical approaches to it, as well as different layers of interpretation is not only academically stimulating, but actually really fun! Coming from a faith background, I often heard that it would ‘challenge my faith’, but faith that is not tested is not faith at all. People also questioned whether I embarked on the course to eventually become the ‘first Black Archbishop of Canterbury’, another amusing hypothesis that comes with the Tripos. In the UK, I feel we are so fortunate that our degrees and professions don’t necessarily need to match, unless we are going into something very technical that requires loads of prior knowledge! With this, it meant that I could choose a discipline out of pure interest. What I really enjoy about the Tripos too is that it engages and grapples with a lot of conceptual and philosophical content that I enjoy in the subject. It is of testament to the degree structure that I have peers who are interested in completely different areas of Theology, Religion and the Philosophy of Religion. Though inextricably linked, these three areas are different in their own right, and cater to each student’s interest. Although the oldest degree at Cambridge, it’s clear that the Tripos stays relevant. Rarely do you get the opportunity to be taught in a subject that you are genuinely interested in by vanguards in the field, for three years!AMY studied Maths, Chemistry, Philosophy and Ethics at A-level and German at AS-levelWhen choosing GCSEs, A Levels or a degree, I have always chosen my favourite subjects even if they seemed to have no direct relevance to each other. This tactic lead me to choose Maths, Chemistry, Philosophy and Ethics, and German AS at Sixth Form. When considering a university course, I realised that although Chemistry and Maths were fun, the questions and ideas I looked at in RS were much more significant and interesting to study and as religion seems to be an ever important part of society, so I looked into theology.As someone who had always done a mix of subjects at school, the scope of Theology as a subject was really appealing, especially at Cambridge where the course is so diverse and you are free to choose most of your modules from Year 1. You can study language, history, literature, philosophy, biblical studies, sociology, theology or religious studies. Although there were lots of areas of TRS that I hadn’t studied before, e.g. I’d not done history since year 9 and never really liked English Literature at school, I still had an interest in these fields and when combined with the general theme of religion and belief, I knew they would be really interesting.Despite ditching science, Maths and Chemistry (and German AS) have been really useful, especially in the language paper as you have to learn and understand lots of grammatical rules and use them logically to solve the puzzle of translating a Greek sentence.© 2017 University of CambridgeWe may use cookies to record some preference settings and to analyse how you use our web site.
