						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownContents:   genres / advising / choosing courses / incompletes/  choosing thesis advisor/ the thesis/ financial / teaching/  department review process / statement of evaluation & warning /  grievance procedures /  leaves of absence /  job placement / computer services/ conference travel As a student in Literary Arts, you are in a unique position among graduate students. You have the opportunity to choose a number of your eight semester-long courses from any university department or program. Though the Graduate School requires that you take classes appropriate to your graduate status, you have the freedom to design much of your curriculum. When a new class of undergraduates arrives at Brown, each of them, too, must choose courses without the constricting guidelines of distribution requirements. The first-year undergraduates, however, have eight semesters with which to experiment. Since you have just three or four courses to work with, and nothing like the undergraduate’s safety net of faculty and peer advising, you will want to make good choices the first and every time. As long as you feel your courses will help you in your writing, the department will support your choice.We have designed this handbook not only to introduce you to our policies and procedures, but also to prepare you for making the decisions that will shape your two years at Brown. Our statements parallel and incorporate official statements, when appropriate. Through we have tried not to omit any crucial information, we have undoubtedly missed things that you will want to know. The important thing is to ask questions. Your workshop leader, your professors, the chair, the academic program director, the director of graduate studies, your colleagues, students in other programs, are all invaluable sources of information. Your official advisor each semester is your workshop leader; your secondary advisors are the chair and the director of graduate studies; you should feel free, however, to seek advice from any member of the department faculty.It is not part of the scope of this Handbook to provide information on housing, meals, recreation, etc. For this kind of information, you should consult the guide provided by the Brown University Graduate Student Council, along with web sites found through Brown’s A to Z guide.The GenresWhen you enter the Literary Arts Department, you will arrive as a poet, a digital language artist, or a fiction writer. Sometimes, students take graduate workshops in other genres. To do so, approach the instructor of the workshop in the semester before (or during the summer before) the course begins.AdvisingYour official advisor is Thalia Field, director Graduate Studies; however, you should also rely on your workshop (or thesis advisor) for day-to-day concerns. Should you feel it necessary, you may also approach the chair, Cole Swensen. If you are having a problem that needs outside review, you should contact the Graduate School to arrange for a meeting with one of the deans.Choosing CoursesMany students choose to take their non-writing courses via literature departments. If you plan to seek a PhD after completing this degree, you may want to consider studying literature in the English Department, Comparative Literature, the language departments, the Theatre Department, or in Modern Culture and Media. You are not limited to literature courses; the department will support your choice as long as you feel the course will help you in your writing. Students in the past have studied a second language, other arts, such as painting and sculpture, and a wide variety of academic disciplines. Once you venture into such territory, you have to work a little harder to get good advice about courses. Some basic rules are:IncompletesAlthough you should make every effort to avoid taking an incomplete in a course, certain situations may demand that course of action. If you are considering taking an incomplete, you must have the instructor’s permission. Check with the Registrar’s office as to what steps must be taken to complete this process. Incompletes should be completed as soon after the next semester begins as possible. Earning NC’s and carrying Incompletes may affect your standing in the department.Choosing a Thesis AdvisorBy the time you start the fall semester of your second year in the program, you will have studied with at least two faculty members. Sometime in the early part of your third semester, the department will provide you with a thesis advisor preference sheet. You'll be asked to rank the two or three faculty members with whom you'd most like to work. You'll be asked to return the form by a particular deadline. Shortly after the deadline, the department will match you with your advisor. Once your advisor has been assigned, we recommend that you make contact with her or him to begin the process.The ThesisCompleted by the end of April of your second year, your thesis will be a substantial manuscript or project of publishable material—a collection of poetry or short fiction, a novel, long poem or electronic work (or works). It must be formatted according to the guidelines provided by the Graduate School, with one minor exception: the rule about double-spacing does not apply to poets. Early in your second year, you should visit the Graduate School’s web site, where you can download the Graduate School’s requirements.The final copy of the thesis is submitted to the Graduate School in duplicate (the original on high-quality, acid-free paper) and both copies must bear the signature of your advisor. You should follow the Graduate School’s instructions exactly—they mean business. You will work on this project with your thesis advisor, getting credit (through LITR 2410) during the second semester of that year. You’ll arrange a schedule with your advisor so as to meet the Graduate School’s deadlines. In order to ensure feedback, it is important that you submit a final draft to her or him several weeks in advance of the final deadline.You should register for LITR 2410.Financial InformationIt is the department’s goal to provide financial aid to all students in good standing. In the first year, typical aid is through a fellowship, and includes: a stipend, health fee, health insurance and tuition (for two courses a semester). In the second year, those who are approved will teach an undergraduate workshop in the fall and the spring semesters. They will receive a stipend, health fee, health insurance and tuition (two courses a semester).Guaranteed student loans are available through the university. You should visit the Graduate School’s web page for more details on this.TeachingIn order to teach for the department in your second year, we expect first-year MFA students to attend the teaching practicum sessions led by the Director of Graduate Study. One or two sessions will take place in the fall, and a few intensive sessions will take place in the spring semester, during your first year. These sessions will be augmented by your visiting at least one workshop led by a second-year graduate student. If you receive an appointment to teach an undergraduate writing workshop, you’ll likely lead an introductory or intermediate workshop. You will be responsible for designing a syllabus, ordering books, leading workshop, holding office hours and submitting grades.All introductory and intermediate workshops are limited to 17 students, and are graded on an S/NC (Satisfactory/No Credit) basis. While you won’t need to worry about assigning letter grades, in order for your students to pass, they must meet the course requirements, spelled out clearly in your syllabus.Department’s Review ProcessAfter each of your first three semesters, you will be given a Course Performance Evaluation form. You will have the opportunity to self-evaluate your performance in the workshop. Once you have returned the form to the department office, your workshop instructor will write an evaluation of your work. You will receive a copy, and a copy will go into your file.Evaluations deal with any aspect of your work—for instance, your class participation—but will likely focus largely on the quality of your writing.Each spring, the faculty will meet to evaluate all first-year students.  In this meeting, faculty will discuss each student’s progress. Should any concerns emerge, the chair will arrange a meeting with the particular student to discuss a course of action, and if needed, will report this to the Graduate School.If you standing in the department becomes unsatisfactory, you will notified of this, by the chair, in writing.Graduate School Statement on Evaluation and WarningOn 22 March 1978, the Graduate Council adopted the following statement:At least once a year, the status and progress of every graduate student in a department shall be reviewed and evaluated. This evaluation and the grounds upon which it is based shall be entered in writing in the student’s file and a copy provided to the student. Students shall have the opportunity to add to their files at any time.No student shall be withdrawn for academic reasons from a program without at least a semester’s forewarning of their possible termination.A student receiving aid shall not have the aid terminated without a semester’s forewarning for sufficient cause. Reasons for termination of financial aid shall be placed in the student’s file in writing and a copy given to the student.Grievance ProcedureStudents having trouble with a faculty member should consult the director of graduate studies. The Graduate School has adopted a university-wise grievance procedure, to which you may turn if less formal measures fail. If you want to discuss your situation with someone outside the department, contact the Dean of the Graduate School; to review the university grievance policy on the Institutional Diversity webpage.If one of your students complains about your teaching and you cannot resolve the problem yourself, you should consult with the assistant director or the chair. If the issue cannot be resolved at that point, you should take the matter to the Graduate School’s grievance process.Leaves of AbsenceIf you plan to leave Brown for one or more semesters before you receive your degree, you may apply for a leave of absence. You should write a letter to the Associate Dean of the Graduate School, requesting a leave and stating the reason; you should provide a copy of this request to the chair. The chair will write a letter to the Graduate School, indicating the department’s support of your request. The Graduate School grants permission and notifies the chair. Such leaves are granted for up to one year (two semesters). Returns from Leaves of AbsenceDuring the semester prior to the one in which you plan to return to Brown, you should write a letter to the Associate Dean of the Graduate School, with a copy to the chair, stating your desire to resume study. You can wait until you return to campus to register for courses.If you will need financial support, you must notify the chair of your intention to return before 1 February (whether you plan to return in the fall or spring of the following academic year). Leaving the department midway jeopardizes your financial aid as a whole, not just your opportunity to teach. The department will do its best to help you secure financial aid, but can make no promises.ReadmissionIf you have been away from Brown for longer than one year, you are no longer considered actively enrolled in a degree program, and must reapply to be reinstated. In order to initiate this process, write a letter to the Associate Dean of the Graduate School, with a copy to the chair. Either the chair or a representative will contact you to let you know what steps you must take at that time.Job PlacementIf you intend to search for a job that starts right after graduation, or even if you won’t be looking until years later, you should build a dossier through Interfolio. You can learn more about Interfolio through Brown’s Career Planning office on Angell Street. Through this service, you can have faculty members (at Brown and elsewhere) place letters on file, which may then be sent out at your request.Computer ServicesWe recommend that you activate your Brown account as soon as you get your Brown ID. You can do this at activate.brown.edu. If you wish to forward your Brown electronic mail to another account, you can do it immediately after activating your Brown account; however, you will still need your Brown username and password for things like the computer clusters, online grades, registering for classes…While the department is largely a Mac-based community, our graduate computer room has both Mac and PC platforms. We appreciate your being respectful of the machines in the computer room and that you report any problems to the program manager as soon as one crops up.Conference TravelGraduate students who have been invited to present papers at academic conferences can apply to the Graduate School for up to $500 to cover travel related expenses. Only students in their second year (or thereafter) are eligible to apply for this reimbursement. For conference travel reimbursement instructions, visit: Conference Travel-Graduate SchoolThe Graduate Student International Travel Fund is available to full-time Brown graduate students for assistance in meeting the costs of one professional journey per academic year. The travel stipend may be used for a trip to deliver a paper at an international conference. The fund is not designed to cover field work.The application and information for this is available at:  IATF - Graduate StudentsProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownSome candidates find it useful to visit schools to get a feel for each particular program in advance of applying. While some institutions hold the occasional open house, Brown's Literary Arts Department does not hold any such formal program for its applicants.  The majority of our applicants do not visit campus in anticipation of their application, and such visits will not provide an advantage to those candidates in the admission review process. Indeed, the department is not able to arrange for class visits by prospective students (with 800 to 900 applicants, the workshop experience would be dramatically changed by the regular presence of guests). Further, we do not encourage contact with the program faculty during the admission review period (15 December through 15 February).Should you wish to make a campus visit, we recommend that you schedule it either in conjunction with one of the department's events or with an afternoon demitasse (generally held every Thursday from 4 to 5 pm when university is in session), thereby ensuring informal contact with graduate students and faculty members.To meet with a faculty representative in your genre, you may contact: Cross-Disciplinary:  Thalia_Field@brown.edu  (lead instructor in discipline)Digital Language Arts:  John_Cayley@brown.edu (lead instructor in discipline)Fiction Writing:  Contact main office at 401-863-3260 or writing@brown.eduPoetry Writing:  Gale Nelson (Gale_Nelson@brown.edu) (Academic Program Director)These individuals can best ascertain the availability of faculty within a given genre; as our faculty are often tightly-scheduled, please contact the appropriate faculty representative prior to finalizing your travel arrangements.  Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownBelow are common questions asked by past applicants to the MFA Program.Application Process / Writing Sample & Personal Statement / Academic History / Recommendations / Transcripts  / Financial / Foreign Students / Contact InformationOnline Application Process  For questions regarding the electronic application process, please refer to Online Application on the Graduate School website.  What are my chances of getting in?  In the past few years, the department has received between 800 and 900 applications.  This year, the department anticipates offering admission to four or five fiction writers, four or five poets, and one or two electronic writers, and one cross-disciplinary writer.Can I get advice from a faculty member regarding my application?We’re sorry to say that the department is not in a position to critique an applicant’s manuscript, either before or after the application process takes place.What is the suggested length for my writing sample? The suggested length of a writing sample is:How do I get the writing sample to you? Applicants submit a writing sample in plain-text format (preferably as a PDF document) less than 5 megabytes in size as part of the onlineapplication.  If your work cannot easily be sent in this format (i.e.,it has sculptural elements that you do not feel you can document inany but three-dimensional models), send it by regular mail to:Graduate School, Brown University, Box 1867, Providence, RI 02912. Youmay also include web address links for works that are best readonline.I want to send three short stories, but can only upload one document. What should I do? Format your three stories into one document – start each story on its own page, and run the story title in a larger typeface than the rest of the text, so we can tell there are multiple texts.I want to send my writing sample by hard copy, but apply through the online system.  What do I do when I come upon the electronic spaces for the writing sample on the electronic application? The electronic system will not let you submit your application without uploading something in the Writing Sample field.  If you want to submit this by hard copy, when you get to this part of the online application, you should upload a document that says “Writing sample is coming as hard copy” and another (if applicable), “Personal statement coming as hard copy.”  Once you have done so, you will be able to move forward and submit the electronic application.I want to apply to the Cross-Disciplinary MFA track.  But I can’t upload my paintings/sculptures/dance performance into the Online Application!  How should I go about submitting my materials?Applicants to the Cross-Disciplinary track of the Literary Arts MFA, who need to submit materials from a secondary art form – paintings, sculpture, video, music, etc. – may submit their materials in a variety of ways.1).  Upload a portfolio that includes both your writing and any images of  your other, relevant materials.  Combine your writing and images into a single document; convert it to a .pdf, and then upload the .pdf into the “Writing Sample” field of the online application.2).    Include, in your writing sample, a page containing links to websites where images of your non-writing work may be viewed (or, in the case of music, listened to).3).  If absolutely necessary, you may send physical artworks or discs to us via snail mail.  Address your materials to the Brown University Graduate School, Box 1867, Providence, RI  02912.  Be sure to include a cover letter specifying that you are applying to the MFA in Literary Arts – Cross-Disciplinary track.What should I say in my Personal Statement – and how long should it be? We suggest that you think of it as an introduction to your writing sample.  You can talk about yourself, your aesthetics, your past experiences, why you think Brown Literary Arts is a good fit for you, etc.  While the Graduate School asks that your personal statement be no more than two pages, our Department recommends that your personal statement be 1-4 double-spaced pages.When entering my educational history, after I type my school's name into the school finder, the finder cannot find my school. What should I do? You can manually enter your school information. Simply type the school's name directly onto the application form (this may require you to provide a few more details, such as city and country, but this should be relatively simple for you to do).I went to a school that did not have a 4-point GPA system. I want Brown to understand my grades, but am not sure how best to do this. What do I do?Under Select Your GPA Scoring Type, choose Non-Numerical. For Non-Numerical Grades, choose Descriptive Grade. This will yield three fields: your grade, highest possible grade and passing grade. You can type in these fields the information you wish to share. Please note that the GPA will not be a primary basis for determining entrance into our program.If I am applying online, where do I get the recommendation forms for my referees? When completing the application, you may register your referees’ names and electronic mail addresses.  The referees will receive email telling them that they’ve been registered and by whom, and will be provided with login information so that they can visit the site and upload the recommendations.  What if I am using a dossier service for my letters of reference? Research whether or not the dossier service can upload letters on your behalf. If the service can do so, follow the directions provided by that service for completing this information on your Brown application.If your dossier service cannot upload letters on your behalf, you may have them sent to the Graduate School in hard copy to: Brown University, Graduate School, Box 1867, Providence RI 02912.Do my letters of recommendation have to be from my college professors? While the Graduate School suggests that at least two letters come from instructors with whom you have worked, we encourage you to arrange for letters from any three people who can speak cogently about you as a writer, whether or not they have been your teacher.What if a recommendation is sent after the 15 December deadline? If your application form, personal statement and writing sample have been received by the deadline, then your application will be reviewed, even if a letter of reference hasn’t yet arrived.  Of course, letters that arrive on time may affect your candidacy.   Letters must be received by 20 January at the latest in order to be reviewed along with the rest of your application.Do I need to submit original transcripts? No - you should upload your transcripts as a PDF file. If you have attended more than one institution, make the series of transcripts into one multi-page PDF file. If you are accepted to Brown, you’ll need to have original transcripts sent from your schools to Brown prior to enrolling.  Do I need to complete the FAFSA?  Yes.  ALL  applicants who are U.S. citizens who are seeking departmental aid must complete the FAFSA.  This is true even if you don't plan to apply for student loans.  You should complete the FAFSA in January. International students do not need to complete the FAFSA.I believe that I should be eligible for an application fee waiver. What should I do?  Your completed application must be submitted 14 days in advance of the program’s application deadline in order to be considered for a fee waiver. Please choose the “Request a fee waiver” option as your method of payment on the payment information page. For more information on waivers see Application Fee Waiver on the Graduate School website.Is there a foreign language requirement/exam?  No.I'm an international student. Do I have to submit TOEFL or IELTS results? Language proficiency exams are not required of those students who have earned a degree from a non-U.S. university where the primary language of instruction is English, or from a college or university in the United States, or in any of the following countries: Australia, Bahamas, Botswana, Cameroon, Canada (except Quebec), Ethiopia, Ghana, Ireland, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Tanzania, Gambia, Uganda, United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales), West Indies, Zambia.

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownOver the last two decades, all incoming MFA students received full funding; packages for Literary Arts students generally take the following forms:In the first year, all graduate students receive a fellowship that pays a monthly stipend and covers tuition, the health fee, and health insurance. Fellowships do not require employment or teaching. The stipend for the 2017-2018 academic year is $25,010.Between the first and second academic year, students in good standing receive a summer stipend of $2,775.In the second year, all graduate students in good standing who are qualified will be awarded teaching assistantships. Teaching assistants teach one undergraduate writing workshop per semester, and receive a full stipend, tuition, health fee, and health insurance. The stipend for the 2017-2018 academic year is $25,010.Stipends are paid monthly, in equal installments.*Please note that ALL U.S. applicants must complete a FAFSA in order to receive departmental funding, whether or not you plan to take out a supplementary student loan*.  You should file your FAFSA during the month of January.Students who need additional funds can also apply for a Guaranteed Student Loan.  To research loan borrowing options and other financing alternatives, including an Installment Payment plan, go to the Financing & Support page on the Graduate School website. International students are eligible for all forms of aid except for federally-supported loans and federally-supported work study.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Literary Arts MFA Program at Brown is structured to allow graduate student writers maximum possible time for creative and intellectual exploration.   Students attend two courses per semester:  a writing workshop and an elective.  Elective courses may be selected from among the full offerings of the Brown University curriculum.  In years past, students have taken courses in literature, history, philosophy, theater arts, modern culture and media, religious studies, and foreign languages.  Studio fine arts courses and translation workshops are often appropriate choices – as are workshops offered on special topics or in other genres.In their final semester, instead of taking a workshop, graduate students work independently with a faculty advisor on thesis preparation.  The thesis is a substantial work of electronic arts, fiction, or poetry – or may cross genre boundaries.  It is intended to represent the student’s achievement during the two years in residency at Brown.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownFiction students at Brown complete a program of workshops, independent studies and electives designed to provide feedback for an eclectic mix of talented writers who are in the process of refining or defining their artistic visions.  Through readings, assignments, and discussion of works in progress, instructors encourage the inherent diversity of approaches to the art of writing that are found within the graduate writing community.Fiction faculty:  Colin Channer, Robert Coover (Emeritus), Thalia Field, Carole Maso, Meredith SteinbachLike Fiction students, Poetry students at Brown complete a program of workshops, independent studies and electives that emphasize feedback and exposure to many literary traditions and anti-traditions.  Poets are encouraged to develop their independent voices and unique artistic visions through readings, assignments, and discussion of works in progress, as well as through participation in a vibrant and diverse literary community. Poetry faculty:  Forrest Gander, Cole Swensen, Keith Waldrop (Emeritus)Since the early 1990s, Brown has been at the forefront of what is widely known as Electronic Writing, or, in other contexts, Electronic or Digital Literature, or Literary Hypermedia. Today we acknowledge that all writing practices are reliant on the support of new technologies and that certain, increasingly prominent, practices of language art are profoundly influenced and changed by networked and programmable media. Digital Language Arts discovers and explores practices of aesthetic writing that emerge when digital technologies and digital cultures allow writing to work with other artistic media across disciplines, such as those offered by Brown's music, visual art, Modern Culture and Media, Computer Science, and Theater and Performance Studies departments, and by RISD, especially its Digital+Media graduate program.  While our students are encouraged to work in mixed hypermedia, including aesthetic computation, creative hacking, computer graphics, animation, electronic music and sound art, digital video, and even artificial 3D audiovisual environments, the focus is still on writing, and on taking the writer/language artist's commitment to language-as-medium seriously. Working in an artificial 3D audiovisual environment (known as a CAVE or 'CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment') is one of the Brown Literary Arts Department's specialties; with the support of Brown's Center for Computation and Visualization, we regularly teaching 'Cave Writing' in the highly collaborative context of the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. Digital Language Arts works to facilitate all kinds of collaborative projects.John Cayley directs Digital Language Arts at Brown and Robert Coover is emeritus faculty.Literary Arts has established a graduate track designed to give students the opportunity to explore interdisciplinary methods and issues. For those who apply to work as Cross-Disciplinary MFA candidates, the program faculty anticipates that these practitioners will have work that incorporates materials from a discipline other than writing, such as music, visual art, or performance art.   Note:  This track is NOT for students who want to work in more than one genre of writing.  All accepted MFA graduate students have the opportunity to attend workshops in genres other than their primary genre (fiction students may take a poetry workshop, for example).Cross-Disciplinary faculty:  John Cayley and  Thalia FieldThe Playwriting program has moved to Theater Arts and Performance Studies.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownAdmission is highly selective, and is based primarily on the quality of the applicant’s writing.  Your writing sample, therefore, is the most important part of your application.  In putting your sample together, you should emphasize quality rather than length.  Your writing sample should be in a single genre.The suggested length of a writing sample is: Fiction:  30 – 40 pages (double-spaced is typical; you may use an alternative format if integral to the work.)Poetry:   15 – 20 pages  (any format)Digital Language Arts:   one or two electronic projectsCross-Disciplinary:  30 – 50 pages  (any format)Please note that writing samples may comprise a single work; an excerpt from a longer work; or multiple short works.  If you want to be considered in more than one genre, you must complete two separate applications, including two separate application fees and two separate writing samples. Applicants’ writing samples are reviewed for admission by at least two members of the faculty.  Because the Literary Arts Department receives a large number of applications, faculty members cannot provide critiques of individual samples.  The Department does not grant interviews to prospective students.A completed application should include:These items must be electronically postmarked by the 15 December deadline.  The online application system will no longer process new or incomplete applications after 11:59 pm EST on 15 December.  If your application is pending but not sent by that deadline, it WILL NOT get processed.GRE scores (subject or general) are not required (nor are they given consideration).While you must post the information by the deadline, the referees may submit their letters through the online system after the 15 December deadline has passed.Applicants who have previously completed all or part of an advanced degree in creative writing at another university should include a separate letter explaining what special circumstances lead them to pursue an MFA at Brown (this should be uploaded with your personal statement -- but should start a new page, and carry a header of "Work toward a master's degree in a related field"). Without this explanatory letter, the faculty will not review the application.  (The primary accepted basis for completing a second advanced degree in writing is the stated desire to pursue work in a different genre.)All applications must be submitted electronically at the online application web site using one of the following browsers Firefox (within latest 2 versions); Microsoft Internet Explorer (8.0 and above); Chrome (within latest 2 versions); Safari (5.1.7+ or latest version).During the month of January, applicants who are US citizens (or holders of permanent resident status from the US State Dept.) should complete the Federal Financial Aid Form, listing Brown as a school to which results should be sent. Not completing this process may jeopardize financial aid offers.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe undergraduate concentration in Literary Arts at Brown is designed to allow student writers to develop their skills in one or more genres while deepening their understanding of the craft of writing.  Concentration requirements are intended to balance creative and critical concerns.  To complete a concentration in Literary Arts, students must take ten courses:Required reading courses, selected in consultation with a concentration advisor, may come from, but are not limited to, the following departments:  Africana Studies, American Civilization, Classics, Comparative Literature, East Asian Studies, Egyptology, French Studies, German Studies, Hispanic Studies, Italian Studies, Judaic Studies, Linguistics, Literatures and Cultures in English, Middle East Studies, Modern Culture and Media, Music, Portuguese and Brazilian Studies, Slavic Studies, South Asian Studies, Theatre, Speech and Dance, and Visual Arts.Of the ten total courses required for the concentration in Literary Arts, at least four must be taken at the 1000-level or above.  Up to four classes taken at another institution or from another department at Brown may count toward the concentration if approved by the Program Director.  Two of the ten courses may also count toward the fulfillment of a second concentration. All concentrators must take at least one course from among the Literary Arts offerings during the senior year.There is no thesis requirement for completing this concentration.Concentration Advisor:To establish your Literary Arts concentration, you'll need to complete the online declaration form, found on the Registrar’s web page.To learn more about the concentration, and before you file concentration forms, we recommend that you make an appointment with Gale Nelson -- contact him by electronic mail at Gale_Nelson@brown.edu.Gale Nelson's office is Room 109, Literary Arts Building, 68 1/2 Brown StreetProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownContents:   requirements / advising / honors / frequent questions/__________________________________________________The undergraduate program in Literary Arts at Brown is designed to allow student writers to develop their skills in one or more genres, while deepening their understanding of the craft of writing. Concentration requirements are intended to balance creative and critical concerns. By the time they graduate, concentrators should possess critical acumen, attain fluency in writing in general and within one or more genres as well. The department also wants our concentrators to learn something about an art: to gain a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment in developing their craft and sensibility as artists.Concentrators must take four workshop courses from among LITR 110, 210, 310, 610, 1010, 1110, 1150, 1310 and 1510. At the discretion of the concentration advisor, workshop credit may also be given for Playwriting workshops given by the departments of Africana Studies and Theatre and Performance Studies; credit may also be given for 1000-level writing courses given through the English Department. Concentrators must also take six literature courses*, including: a course in literary theory or history of literary criticism; two courses that cover reading and research in literary arts created before the 20th century (these must cover two distinct time periods); and one course that covers literary arts created after the 19th century.During the senior year, all concentrators must take one course from among the Literary Arts offerings (designated as LITR or cross-listed by LITR). At least four courses counted toward the concentration must be at the 1000-level. At least six courses counted toward the concentration must be taken in the Literary Arts Department (with the approval of the concentration advisor, the rest may be taken at other institutions or other departments at Brown that offer literature courses).No more than two courses may count toward the Literary Arts concentration and toward a second concentration.*By literature courses, the department means courses where the primary readings for the course are works of literature.To learn more about the concentration and before you file your concentration forms online, we recommend that you make an appointment with Gale Nelson -- contact him by electronic mail at Gale_Nelson@brown.edu. Gale Nelson's office is Room 109, Literary Arts Building, 68 1/2 Brown Street. To establish your Literary Arts concentration, you'll need to visit the Registrars website, where you can complete the concentration filing process online.Literary Arts concentrators who wish to complete their concentration with Honors in Creative Writing must include two 1000-level workshops or independent studies among their courses and must, in addition, complete a thesis. The thesis is a substantial body of work that reflects the student’s achievement during his/her years in the Department: a collection of stories or poems, a novel, a play, screenplay, a literary translation, a cross-disciplinary project or an extended electronic/mixed media project. Students may complete a thesis by taking either LITR 1510 (an independent study) or by taking LITR 1410 (the Honors workshop).Students wishing to complete Honors in Cross-Disciplinary writing must take either two special topics workshops, one special topics plus one genre workshop, or one workshop in each of two different genres.Applications to the Honors Program are due between the first day of the fall semester and 20 September (or the first Monday thereafter if the 20th falls on a weekend). Applications are considered annually. In order to apply, candidates must have taken OR be taking a workshop in the respective genre at the 1000-level (the workshop may be LITR 1010, 1110 or 1150; LITR 1310 also makes one eligible). Candidates may apply in more than one genre (if eligible), but will do ONE thesis (with the thesis advisor’s consent, a thesis may cross the boundaries of genre). Theses are typically completed in the senior year, and are due on 13 April (Samuel Beckett’s birthday) or the Monday thereafter when the 13th falls on a weekend). If a concentrator is to complete course work in December, the thesis may be completed by the previous 13 April, by the end of December, or by the following 13 April (the date selected must be agreed upon by the thesis advisor). Most students complete the thesis through an honors independent study or through an honors workshop.Do I have to complete a thesis for a Literary Arts concentration?  No; but you must complete a thesis to be considered for honors.If I don’t complete a thesis, what do I do in my senior year? All concentrators must complete at least one course through the Literary Arts program in the senior year. In many cases, this will be a literature seminar or a workshop. This course constitutes the capstone experience in Literary Arts.Do many concentrators pursue a second concentration? We’ve found that about a third of the Literary Arts concentrators complete two concentrations. The “other” concentrations have been spread widely throughout the college – there’s no particular pattern to this. If you have two strong interests, and feel that you can comfortably undertake two concentrations while also having a rich and diverse educational experience, we recommend that you consider this.Do concentrators have advantages over other students in terms of getting into Literary Arts classes? During the registration period, we make ten slots available to concentrators in LITR 210 sections. By registering during that period, concentrators are thereby not required to submit writing samples for these intermediate writing sections. Certain literature courses offered though Literary Arts may also allow concentrators to register without instructor permission (override) during the registration period.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownIf you are a Literary Arts concentrator who has completed or is currently enrolled in a 1000-level Literary Arts Workshop or an appropriate LITR 1110 or 11150 section, you are eligible to apply for Honors in Literary Arts.To apply, you should complete an online application in the Fall semester, typically of the academic year in which the thesis will be completed (thesis work is completed in the Spring semester).  Applications are due between Sept. 8 and Sept. 25 at 11:59 pm.The Honors application will ask a few questions – your name, your class year, your Banner number, etc.  There is also a place to upload a writing sample.  You should upload a writing sample in the genre in which you want to write a thesis.  The sample should be no less than 20 pages of material.  Please note the sample should be a single file, uploaded as a PDF.  (If you want to submit eight really short stories, or 15 poems, please combine them into a single file and send them as one document, even though there are various works under the one umbrella).Once you have submitted the application, the faculty in your genre who will be available to work with you on your thesis will review it.  This review is done independently – each available faculty member will separately review each application, and will submit decisions to the department.  You may, therefore, be accepted into the Honors program by any faculty member within your genre; and by accepting you, the faculty member is agreeing to serve as your advisor (typically through an independent study conducted in the spring of your senior year, but sometimes through an Advanced or Honors workshop).Once you are accepted into the Honors program, you should approach your faculty advisor directly to begin making plans.Please note:1.  You should not approach faculty members and ask them to serve as your advisor before you complete this application process.  This process is designed to ensure that all applicants are given equal consideration, so that the process is fair to everyone.           2.  It is possible to apply for Honors in your junior year; if accepted, you will complete your Honors thesis in the spring of your senior year.  Most students are accepted into Honors, however, in the fall of their senior year.3.  Decisions regarding Honors will be announced in mid-October.  You will be notified via campus mail.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThis material is intended for those advanced undergraduate who have been accepted into the honors/capstone program. As you will be expected to complete a book-length creative manuscript before graduating, we wanted to give you some advice at the outset of this process.Your advisor will play an important role in this process. You should approach that person as soon as you can, and begin to plan how you are going to complete your thesis/project. The advisor selected you as someone s/he is willing to advise; however, if you want to work with another member of the literary arts faculty, you may approach that person. It is up to the faculty members themselves to agree to take you on. It is the obligation of the instructor to say, "I'm sorry, but I cannot work with you" if s/he is already overloaded with advisees.A graduate student may not serve as advisor.Once you have settled on an advisor, you should complete the "Student Advisor Form" (a copy of which will be provided to you upon being accepted into the program).You may want to begin work on the project as soon as possible. With your advisor's permission, you may sign up for an independent study for your seventh semester (LITR 1310) and/or for your final semester (LITR 1510). You may only use LITR 1510 in your final semester.You may also be interested in taking one of the LITR 1410 honors/capstone workshop sections, to be offered in the spring semester. Entry into these sections is at the discretion of the instructors.You should expect to meet with your advisor at regular intervals to discuss your progress. Different projects require different types of advising at different intervals. You should work with your advisor to work out what would be most appropriate. In most cases, writers have found that meeting with an advisor about twice a month is appropriate. Meetings may last as little as 15 minutes and as long as an hour-but usually not for a set length of time.You may find that there are periods in the process where you need different types of help-where a suggested reading or exercise may be more necessary than a close reading. It will be up to both you and your advisor to be aware of what the project needs.Some writers find it useful to set up a time line, working backwards from the date the project is due. Again, this is more useful for some writers (and some projects) than others. Not everyone thinks in terms of self-imposed deadlines, but you need to be reminded that the final deadline is for a finished work, not a draft. You submit two copies of your project to the program office on the date when projects are due no later than 4 p.m.Once you turn in your project, your advisor will have a limited amount of time to read your work and decide whether or not it meets the program's standards for honors or capstone certification. Your advisor will write up a paragraph recommendation, which will be submitted to the program, and then, to the college. You will also get a copy of your advisor's recommendation.Once you've received your advisor's comments, we encourage you to set up a meeting to discuss those comments. If you have specific questions, you should ask at that time.To end each academic year, the program sponsors the Honors/Capstone reading series. You'll be notified of the dates available for sign-up. This marks the primary celebration of your long and hard work. We hope that you find the event festive-and we encourage you to attend the readings of your colleagues.If you have any questions along the way, please discuss them with your advisor or with Gale Nelson, room 109.Second ReadersMany candidates find it useful to have a second reader. You should feel free to approach a member of the faculty to seek input in this capacity. This may be especially useful if you intend to cross the boundaries of genre in your project; or if you have worked closely with two different faculty members, and know that both would provide valuable insights into your project.For administrative purposes, the program will only record and track your first reader.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownDuring your final semester at Brown, there are four ways for you to complete your project:1. Take an advanced workshop (LITR 1010, LITR 1110 or LITR 1150), taught by the instructor advising your project.2. Take one of the Honors/Capstone Workshops (LITR 1410); this option is available in spring only.3. Undertake an independent study in Creative Writing (LITR 1510).4.  Work independently on your project, but receive no course credit for the project. To undertake this option, you must receive permission from your advisor.You must select one from among these choices; you may not get course credit for a workshop and an independent study for the same project in one semester. You may, however, complete an independent study in the fall and then undertake LITR 1410 in the spring (with permission of the instructors).LITR 1010, LITR 1110 & LITR 1150 Advanced Level WorkshopsIf your advisor is teaching an advanced-level workshop, s/he may encourage you to take the workshop to provide a forum for you to undertake the completion of your project. Admission to the workshop is based on a writing sample, due on the first day of the semester.LITR 1410 Honors/Capstone WorkshopsThese workshops are intended as forums for students working on their theses and Capstone projects in creative writing. In consultation with your advisor and the respective workshop leader, you may select to take the workshop appropriate for the genre or an independent study, but cannot choose to do both during the same semester. Instructors of these spring semester workshops (unlike all other undergraduate workshops) will give permission to candidates during the fall semester.If you are interested in taking one of these sections, you should approach the appropriate instructor during the registration period in the fall semester.LITR 1310 Independent Study in Creative WritingThis course is typically taken by Honors/Capstone candidates in their penultimate semester. The instructor should meet with each student at regular intervals (at least every other week); the student should complete a substantial amount of reading and writing over the course of the semester.LITR 1510 Honors/Capstone Ind. Study in Creative WritingThis course is typically taken by Honors/Capstone candidates in their final semester. The instructor should meet with each student at regular intervals (at least every other week); the student should complete a substantial amount of reading and writing over the course of the semester. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

Generally this timeframe starts the first day of classes to the third week of September.On 13 April, present final copy of the project to advisor (if 13 April falls on a weekend or holiday, the thesis is due on the last business day before the 13th); so that we may submit the necessary report to the College on time, the program will expect reports from the faculty reviewers soon after the 13 April deadline. As such, there is little to no room for a deadline extension.Note: whether you finish your course work in the fall or spring semester, the thesis is due on or before 13 April.
