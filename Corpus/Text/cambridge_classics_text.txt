It is also about where we come from and who we are today: many fundamental contemporary ideas, such as current conceptions of law, beauty and justice, come from the classical world. This breadth makes Classics at Cambridge vibrant, challenging and fun. It also makes our graduates highly marketable. In the Guardian's last two University Guides to Classics, Cambridge came top in the country overall and for 'Career Prospects'.Cambridge is a wonderful place to study Classics, with a world-renowned set of specialists, and unique resources such as the Faculty's own Museum of Classical Archaeology and the Fitzwilliam Museum's Department of Antiquities.The Faculty of Classics is committed to finding students with the highest potential, from any educational background from around the globe. Please follow the links for information on the graduate and undergraduate degree courses we offer. (NB You do NOT need to have studied Latin and/or Greek at school to be accepted onto the undergraduate course.)If you find you need any further information, please try the following:'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

(In particular cases, students without a previous degree but with substantial experience of higher or adult education may also be admitted.) Affiliated Students in Classics take a two-year degree, which involves studying for Part 2 of the Classical Tripos. During a two-year Part 2, each student takes five papers from the selection offered (one of which may be replaced by a thesis).You will need to apply to a particular College, so you are recommended to make informal contact with that College first to ensure that they accept affiliated students in Classics. You will then need to submit a UCAS application and, if you are living or studying in a country outside of the EU at the time of application, a Cambridge Online Preliminary Application. For details of application procedures, deadlines, and information about the various Colleges, please see the University’s Undergraduate Study website: http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/access/mature/affiliated.htmlPart 2 of the Classical Tripos consists of a wide range of in-depth papers in the various areas of Classics. Those studying for the two-year Part 2 take five papers in total, one of which can be replaced with a thesis.For the regulations and current syllabus please see the Faculty’s Undergraduate handbook. Because of the great degree of choice available in tailoring the course to individual requirements, the Cambridge Classics Part 2 is suitable for students from a wide range of previous degree courses. It is possible to choose papers that require a knowledge of both Greek and Latin, or of just one language, or of neither. (The papers in Ancient History, Archaeology, and 'Interdisciplinary' approaches do not in general presuppose knowledge of the ancient languages.)Training in basic language skills does not form a part of the examined Part 2 course, but opportunities for the study of Greek and Latin are available both in the University and in the Colleges.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

With nearly three hundred undergraduates, over 90 postgraduates, 36 university teachers, and almost as many postdoctoral researchers, college teachers and retired colleagues, the Faculty is a centre of international importance in the field. There is a list of current Faculty members and their research interests for you to consult. You may also be interested in joining one of our research projects.We offer two courses, a 9-month MPhil in Classics, and the 3-year PhD. In addition, we welcome visiting graduate students and affiliated students, i.e. graduates of other universities who wish to study the final part of our undergraduate course.As well as being the setting for lectures and seminars, the purpose-built Faculty building (extended in 2010) is the home of the Classical Faculty Library, an open-shelf collection of over 60,000 volumes with a computer resources room. With its 24-hour access for keyholders, and the graduate common room located nearby, the Library is the main workplace of many of our graduate students. Students can also use the University Library, which as a legal deposit library can acquire almost every book published in the UK and Ireland, and where the classical holdings complement those of the Faculty’s own Library. Upstairs in the Faculty, the Museum of Classical Archaeology contains one of the very few collections of casts of classical sculpture to survive from the 19th century, together with pottery and epigraphic ‘squeezes’, and we also have a Mycenaean epigraphy collection. The Fitzwilliam Museum, with which the Faculty works closely, has exceptional holdings of classical art and of ancient coins.Each term, the Faculty hosts an unrivalled programme of research seminars across the various disciplines in Classics, with presentations made by academic staff in the Faculty, by scholars visiting from elsewhere in the UK and abroad, and by our own graduate students (see the current seminar list). Every year the Gray and Corbett public lectures are given by leading figures in the subject, and the Laurence and Craven seminars are annual research workshops on a range of classical themes. Students can attend undergraduate lectures in Classics and other Faculties, while the nearby Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities hosts an extensive interdisciplinary programme of seminars and workshops. Once a week, the Graduate Interdisciplinary Seminar gives MPhil and PhD students the opportunity to give papers in an informal graduate-only environment; and there are other opportunities for graduates to organise their own research events too. They are fully involved in the running of the Faculty through representation on the key committees, and often asked to undertake 'supervision' (small-group teaching) of undergraduates. The Faculty is in the fortunate position of having some funds available to support students’ travel abroad for research purposes or to attend conferences in their field.You can also read what some of our recent graduates have to say by looking at some graduate profiles. Under the Current Students tab you can find graduate handbooks with more course details, and our statement of purpose about postgraduate training.Beyond the Faculty, our graduates are also members of a College, which as well as providing pastoral support, a social focus and (in many cases) accommodation, also represents a intellectual community of scholars and students working across the range of subjects taught in the University, in the Sciences and Social Sciences and well as the Humanities: this enriches the intellectual experience of all.We warmly welcome applications from well-qualified students keen to join this thriving international community and pursue graduate-level study in Classics – whether your interest is in Greek and Latin Literature, Philosophy, History, Art and Archaeology, Philology and Linguistics, or Interdisciplinary approaches to the ancient world. Our individual approaches to these subjects differ, but collectively our aim, and our passion, is to understand the ancient world better.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

The number of offers we make is capped centrally and we review applications as a gathered field. Later applicants may find that places are already committed.Note for PhDs: New PhD students can begin their course at the start of any term throughout the year. However, the funding timetable is structured around an autumn start, and the same applies to graduate seminars, Freshers events, etc.All applications are made electronically with an online Applicant Portal through the University's Graduate Admissions Office. The Faculty itself has extra requirements, further to the standard application form. These are uploaded to your application as supporting documents.If you are seeking funding for your course, there are specific deadlines and eligibility criteria for each distinct funding competition. Please check the Graduate Admissions web pages for full details. You can use the Cambridge Funding Search to see which competitions you are automatically considered for. The Faculty also has information on its own funding competitions, here.For funding purposes, the deadline refers to the date on which you submit your online application with supporting documents.  It is vital that you submit your application by the earliest relevant deadline for any funding that you wish to be considered for.If you are applying from outside Cambridge, your application needs to include:Additionally, you may need:If you are a current Classics student in Cambridge, you will not need to supply:If the Applicant Portal prompts you for these items, please upload a document stating, "This condition has been waived".Due to the unusual structure of Cambridge University, these decisions can take a little while to filter through the various committees and departments that must consider them. As a result it may take several weeks for a decision to come through after your interview. We thank you in advance for your patience!Applications are usually considered in gathered fields, grouped around the funding stages. For example, those applying for Gates Funding are considered together, interviewed and then shortlisted for funding, before moving on to the next group.Please be aware that this process may take several months. You can check the status of your application at any time via your applicant portal but if you have any particular queries or concerns please contact us.[1] Research Proposals: While there is a box on the application form for a research proposal, the space is limited and formatting is very sparse. It is recommended that you upload a research proposal (of no more than 500 words) as a separate document.Also note:-MPhil Applicants - As the MPhil is primarily a research course, your chances of acceptance will be greatly improved if you submit a brief research proposal, outlining some of the areas, themes and questions that you might wish to examine. It is also worth considering how these ideas might fit into the framework of the MPhil course (i.e. three essays and a thesis). This does not need to be detailed, as we are well aware that interests change and projects develop.PhD Applicants - You should give as much information as possible about your likely subject of specialization. This should outline the basis for your interest in the proposed subject (including some bibliography), detail your sense of the principal issues of current debate and where you stand with respect to them, and inform us of what exactly you hope to be able to achieve or contribute to our understanding of the field through your own research.This does not prevent you from negotiating a change in your topic later, but it does help us to decide how well we can cater for your needs, whether you are qualified to undertake the research, and who your initial main Supervisor should be. You are free, if you wish, to say on your application form who your preferred Supervisor would be, and you may find it helpful to contact possible Supervisors to discuss possible projects before applying.  (You can find on this site a list of Faculty members and their research interests).[2] Attainments in Classics:MPhil Applicants - Please give us an idea of your experience with the classical world to date. A list of texts that you have read in the original Greek or Latin would be ideal. If you have not previously had an opportunity to read much Latin or Greek, then an idea of the modules you have studied and a list of texts you have studied in translation. This is particularly important if your undergraduate qualification is not entirely in Classical subjects.PhD Applicants - So that we have an idea of the extent of your experience of Greek and Latin where that is relevant to your research proposal, please list all the Latin and Greek texts that you have read at any point in the original language (e.g. Homer Odyssey 11–13; Thucydides 1; Plato Crito, Meno, Laws 10; Lucretius 3, Vergil Eclogues, Georgics 4, Aeneid 1, 4, 8, 12, Juvenal Satires (all); Tacitus Annals15).[3] Samples of Academic Written Work: The Faculty has no rigid requirements for samples of work. We typically receive two essays of up to 5,000 words each, or a single piece of up to 10,000 words. Ideally, we want to see recent academic writing (on a relevant subject) in which the applicant examines a question with some degree of depth. That said, we are aware that many degree courses only ask students to write shorter pieces than this, and that is also acceptable.It is obviously a great help if the work is written in (or translated into) English, but our academics are used to reading work in the major languages of classical scholarship (English, French, German and Italian).'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

It gives students the opportunity to do•          high-level, focused research on a wide range of aspects of the Greek and Roman world (literature, textual criticism, ancient history, art history, archaeology, philosophy, philology, comparative linguistics)•          under the close supervision of leading Cambridge academics•          with the support of the Faculty's fine resources and unique timetable of specialist seminars and skills classes.The course can be tailored to be, in effect, an MPhil in, for example, Latin prose, Ancient Philosophy, Classical Archaeology, Classical Reception, and so on.It provides an excellent training for anyone intent on a doctorate and makes for an intellectually stimulating year in its own right.Specialist seminars form the core of the Cambridge MPhil experience. All MPhil students in Classics attend a research skills seminar on key topics, intellectual and practical. Seminars are targeted to evolving student needs, starting – for example – with sessions on finding a topic, identifying a question and getting the most from one’s supervisor, through fundamental training in deploying and, if appropriate, building databases, interpreting primary sources and so on, to writing research proposals and preparing for the next career stage.In addition to these ‘skills’ seminars, MPhil students also enrol in at least two ‘Text and Topic’ seminar-series (meeting weekly, one in Michaelmas Term, and one in Lent). These series change annually in accordance with the Faculty’s research agenda. For the current topics (2017–18), click here. In Easter Term, all students give short presentations on their thesis topics in a designated work-in-progress seminar. Together, these seminars are a great forum for exchanging ideas, experimenting with arguments, and getting to know fellow students and Faculty.These MPhil seminars are supplemented by optional Graduate classes in Greek and Roman Epigraphy, Greek and Roman Numismatics, Mycenaean Epigraphy, and Paleography and Textual Criticism. MPhil students are also warmly invited to attend undergraduate lecture courses in Classics (current undergraduate courses) and encouraged to take part in the Faculty’s weekly research seminars (including a graduate-run interdisciplinary seminar).For those who need more or less intensive instruction in Greek and Latin, this is available at a variety of levels. There is also (unexamined) training available in academic German.Most students enrolled on the Cambridge MPhil in Classics write three essays (approx. 4,000 words) and a thesis (approx. 10,000 words) over nine months. Some will substitute a language-exam or exercise (e.g. in Mycenaean epigraphy) for one of the essays. For each essay you will work one-to-one with your supervisor (a Cambridge academic with expertise related to your topic), who will guide you through your individual research. For each submitted piece of written work, you will receive a mark and detailed feedback from the Examiners.Normally the minimum standard for admission as an MPhil student is a first-class or a high 2.1 degree (normally with evidence of first-class achievement) from a British university, or the equivalent (e.g. GPA of 3.7 or above) from an overseas university. The qualification need not be entirely in classical subjects, but you will need to have some proven expertise relevant to your preferred area of specialisation.English Language: If English is not your first language, you will also need to satisfy the Faculty’s English language condition (as follows) prior to your admission being confirmed.  You must achieve the minimum requirements in the same sitting, and no more than two years before the start of your course.This condition is waived if you have completed a course equivalent to a UK Bachelor's degree, running for three years or more at an English-language institution in the last two years. For full information, please refer to the University website.Greek & Latin: We are frequently asked whether admission to the MPhil in Classics demands knowledge of Greek and Latin. The answer depends in part on the area in which you wish to specialise. While it might be feasible successfully to take the MPhil in Classical Archaeology without knowledge of the ancient languages, for example, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to tackle a literary topic without expertise in Latin and/or Greek.Scrutiny of applications always involves careful consideration of whether a candidate's linguistic proficiency is appropriate for the topics they are intending to study; for this reason, it is helpful if you lay out in some detail in your application the extent of your knowledge of ancient (and modern) languages. At the same time we also take into account other relevant expertise, such as knowledge of philosophy other than that of the ancient world, or archaeology other than Classical Archaeology. Students who have already studied some Latin and/or Greek, but need to develop their knowledge of the languages, may pursue them further during the MPhil year.MPhil Greek Language Paper: MPhil students who take the MPhil Greek language paper join the Faculty Intensive Greek course taken by undergraduates for the whole of  Michaelmas and Lent term. This involves 5 hours of classes a week, one each day. In addition, attendance is required at a short course at the end of September (from Tuesday to Friday of the week before the beginning of Michaelmas Full Term).Although the Intensive Greek course is aimed at beginners, a significant amount of preparation is required in advance. Attendance at a Summer School (e.g. the JACT Greek Summer School that takes place in late July and early August) is recommended. By means of a summer school and independent study students are expected to complete the study of the ‘Text’ volume of the  JACT Reading Greek course up to and including Section 14 and complete the study of  the ‘Grammar and Exercise’ volume of Reading Greek up to and including Section 18, and to become fully acquainted with the contents of a ‘Language Pack’ which will be provided, so as to be able to perform satisfactorily in a beginning of term test on this material.The schedule of texts during Michaelmas and Lent Term will be as follows:MichaelmasWeeks 1-4: Lysias 1;Weeks 4-6: Ps.-Xenophon, Athenaion Politeia 1–2;Weeks 7-8: Plato, Crito 50a5–end;LentWeeks 1-2: Herodotus 1. 29–46;Weeks 3-8: Euripides, Medea (the choral odes will not form part of the body of text for examination).'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

It gives students the opportunity to do•          high-level, focused research on a wide range of aspects of the Greek and Roman world (literature, textual criticism, ancient history, art history, archaeology, philosophy, philology, comparative linguistics)•          under the close supervision of leading Cambridge academics•          with the support of the Faculty's fine resources and unique timetable of specialist seminars and skills classes.The course can be tailored to be, in effect, an MPhil in, for example, Latin prose, Ancient Philosophy, Classical Archaeology, Classical Reception, and so on.It provides an excellent training for anyone intent on a doctorate and makes for an intellectually stimulating year in its own right.Specialist seminars form the core of the Cambridge MPhil experience. All MPhil students in Classics attend a research skills seminar on key topics, intellectual and practical. Seminars are targeted to evolving student needs, starting – for example – with sessions on finding a topic, identifying a question and getting the most from one’s supervisor, through fundamental training in deploying and, if appropriate, building databases, interpreting primary sources and so on, to writing research proposals and preparing for the next career stage.In addition to these ‘skills’ seminars, MPhil students also enrol in at least two ‘Text and Topic’ seminar-series (meeting weekly, one in Michaelmas Term, and one in Lent). These series change annually in accordance with the Faculty’s research agenda. For the current topics (2017–18), click here. In Easter Term, all students give short presentations on their thesis topics in a designated work-in-progress seminar. Together, these seminars are a great forum for exchanging ideas, experimenting with arguments, and getting to know fellow students and Faculty.These MPhil seminars are supplemented by optional Graduate classes in Greek and Roman Epigraphy, Greek and Roman Numismatics, Mycenaean Epigraphy, and Paleography and Textual Criticism. MPhil students are also warmly invited to attend undergraduate lecture courses in Classics (current undergraduate courses) and encouraged to take part in the Faculty’s weekly research seminars (including a graduate-run interdisciplinary seminar).For those who need more or less intensive instruction in Greek and Latin, this is available at a variety of levels. There is also (unexamined) training available in academic German.Most students enrolled on the Cambridge MPhil in Classics write three essays (approx. 4,000 words) and a thesis (approx. 10,000 words) over nine months. Some will substitute a language-exam or exercise (e.g. in Mycenaean epigraphy) for one of the essays. For each essay you will work one-to-one with your supervisor (a Cambridge academic with expertise related to your topic), who will guide you through your individual research. For each submitted piece of written work, you will receive a mark and detailed feedback from the Examiners.Normally the minimum standard for admission as an MPhil student is a first-class or a high 2.1 degree (normally with evidence of first-class achievement) from a British university, or the equivalent (e.g. GPA of 3.7 or above) from an overseas university. The qualification need not be entirely in classical subjects, but you will need to have some proven expertise relevant to your preferred area of specialisation.English Language: If English is not your first language, you will also need to satisfy the Faculty’s English language condition (as follows) prior to your admission being confirmed.  You must achieve the minimum requirements in the same sitting, and no more than two years before the start of your course.This condition is waived if you have completed a course equivalent to a UK Bachelor's degree, running for three years or more at an English-language institution in the last two years. For full information, please refer to the University website.Greek & Latin: We are frequently asked whether admission to the MPhil in Classics demands knowledge of Greek and Latin. The answer depends in part on the area in which you wish to specialise. While it might be feasible successfully to take the MPhil in Classical Archaeology without knowledge of the ancient languages, for example, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to tackle a literary topic without expertise in Latin and/or Greek.Scrutiny of applications always involves careful consideration of whether a candidate's linguistic proficiency is appropriate for the topics they are intending to study; for this reason, it is helpful if you lay out in some detail in your application the extent of your knowledge of ancient (and modern) languages. At the same time we also take into account other relevant expertise, such as knowledge of philosophy other than that of the ancient world, or archaeology other than Classical Archaeology.

This includes students who are not currently studying Classical Civilization, Ancient History, or the ancient languages, but are interested in the possibility of doing so.Click here to download a flyer with further details.If you're interested in visiting the Faculty with your school, please get in touch with Jennie Thornber to discuss individual needs. We are very happy to arrange a tour of the Faculty's Museum of Classical Archaeology, and to discuss the possibility of a talk with a Cambridge academic and a visit to one of the Colleges. Please contact Jennie at jlt39@cam.ac.uk or (01223) 767044. We look forward to hearing from you.The Faculty participates in a number of activities for schools, such as Oxbridge Classics Open Days, University Open Days, Taster Days in Latin and Classics, AS and A Level Study Days, and College Open Days. Most of these are completely free to attend.Please click here for details.The Faculty is committed to encouraging the teaching of Classical Civilisation and Ancient History as well as the ancient languages in schools. We run an annual training event for teachers (both specialists and non-specialists). This includes opportunities to hear from Cambridge experts on subject content, as well as dedicated sessions from experienced teachers on teaching practice, the practicalities of setting up Classical Civilisation in your school, and teaching the subject as a non-specialist. The Faculty runs an annual short video competition. School students in Years 9-13 (aged 13 to 19) are welcome to take part by entering a YouTube video of less than four minutes about any aspect of the Classical World.Previous winning entries.More details about this year's competition.Several Cambridge colleges run essay competitions related to Classics, for students in year 12. Whether you are planning to apply to Cambridge or not, we encourage you to get involved. If you are studying Latin in Years 12 and 13 and want to get some ‘university tuition’ on your set texts, check out the following commentaries on Cicero, Tacitus, and Virgil, using the links below. They are all published by Cambridge-based Open Book Publishers and available free to read online via their website and on Google Books:If you have comments or feedback that you would like to share with the authors, please email Ingo Gildenhard at ig297@cam.ac.uk.The Faculty also provides a dedicated Outreach website aimed at school-age students, www.greeksromansus.classics.cam.ac.uk. This contains a collection of short videos, articles, and blogposts about Classical topics and about studying classics at university. We are also on social media at:Facebook: The Greeks, The Romans & UsTwitter: @CamClassicsCambridge is also the home of the Cambridge School Classics Project, which aims to make the classical world accessible to as many students as possible and offers superb resources and opportunities for anybody teaching classics in schools. For their website click here. Many Cambridge classicists write not only for fellow scholars but also for the general public. They are among the editors and frequent contributors to Omnibus, the journal produced twice a year by the Classical Association and aimed at sixth-formers. Every issue contains a dozen or so short articles on aspects of Classics, written by those who teach in universities. It is available for the cost of postage, see:http://www.classicalassociation.org/teaching.htmlThe Journal of Classics Teaching stands in a long line of previous journals, reviews, newsletters and bulletins which have investigated, reported and evaluated the teaching of classical subjects in schools and universities in the UK and abroad.  JCT has its origins in Latin Teaching, the journal of the Association for the Reform of Latin Teaching (now Association for Latin Teaching), developing from there through Didaskalos, the journal of the Joint Association of Classical Teachers, and Hesperiam, The JACT Review and The JACT Bulletin. JCT aims to describe events and practices in classics teaching which are much more than just of interest to teachers in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. We intend to make it a journal which is influential through the discussion and dissemination of successful pedagogical approaches, and in which arguments are grounded in hard data and observed phenomena in and out of the classics classroom. We invite contributors from abroad as well as from the UK, as we believe that the best ideas about the teaching of classical subjects flourish as a result of the cross-fertilisation of experience from different educational programmes across the world. We look for pieces which reflect the experiences of teachers at all levels. Finally, we will continue to report on significant events in the world of classics teaching: JCT will still be the teachers’  ‘parish noticeboard’ and reviews of books and other resources, including ICT and film, which can be used in the classroom, will continue to appear.https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-classics-teachingThe Faculty often receives requests for what reading we would recommend to anyone interested in studying Classics.  Our online book list offers insight into all areas of classical study, and includes many books written by academics here in Cambridge.There are a number of excellent summer schools for learning Greek and Latin (further details of what is on offer can be found on the JACT website). Among these is the Bryanston Greek Summer School.The 50th JACT Greek Summer School will take place at Bryanston School in Dorset from Sunday 30th July to Saturday 12th August 2017. Applications do not open until 1st February 2017 (later than usual) and the closing date is 31st March. The summer school provides two weeks of intensive tuition in Ancient Greek for students aged between 16 and 25 at all levels from complete beginners to those studying for A-level.Tutors on the course are experienced teachers from schools and universities around the UK. The course also offers opportunities to attend lectures and seminars on a wide range of topics relating to Ancient Greece, as well as two dramatic productions. It is a fantastic way to get a taste of what it would be like to study Classics at university and can be especially valuable for students who are at schools where there are not many others with whom they can share their passion for Classics. If the summer school is over-subscribed, priority goes to beginners and intermediate students.Please refer to our website greeksummerschool.org for full details, including how to apply for financial support. We aim to provide bursaries to ensure that all those who would benefit from the course are able to attend, regardless of their financial circumstances. 'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

Study of Latin and Greek language and literature is central to each, and on top of that you can choose from a range of aspects including ancient history, art and archaeology, linguistics, ancient philosophy, and modern responses to classical antiquity, to tailor your own curriculum. There are many opportunities to travel for study trips or archaeological digs.IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR 2017All applicants for Classics are required to take an assessment at interview, if interviewed.Candidates who have passed, or are taking, A level Latin or the equivalent will be expected to take a single at-interview assessment, consisting of a one hour unseen translation (while this is the only test required of all applicants, individual colleges may additionally set their own tests). Glosses in accordance with the OCR vocabulary list will be provided. The Greek translation test will be sat only by those who do not have Latin A level or equivalent, and do have Greek. If you are applying for the 4 year course, you will have a separate assessment interview. Details and examples of all these can be found in the Classics Admissions Assessment Specification.More information about the Admissions Assessment can be found HERE.Please see the University prospectus online for general information about the Classics courses, or continue to our pages dedicated to the four-year and three-year degrees.

It brings together the study of language, linguistics, literature, history, philosophy, art and archaeology.For students who do not have Latin A level (or equivalent), Cambridge offers a four-year undergraduate course. Students learn both languages during the course, and no prior experience is assumed. This makes the course ideal if you have a strong interest in the classical world but have not yet had the chance to study the languages at all, or have only had the opportunity to study Latin or Greek to GSCE level.Cambridge has some of the most committed teachers in the world. All believe strongly that the study of the ancient world is both fascinating in itself and provides knowledge and skills of life-long relevance for their students.Use the navigation column on the left to explore the course in more detail.

If you have Latin A level or equivalent and are thinking of applying for the three-year version of the degree, you can skip over the section on Prelims.Prelims is devoted largely to intensive study of Latin. Experts in language instruction will guide you and, as your skills improve, you will move from textbooks to Latin literature by Cicero, Ovid, Catullus and even the Emperor Augustus. However, there is much more on offer than language classes: the Latin that you study is set in the general context of Roman culture through lectures and supervisions. (For more info on the types of teaching, see the How We Teach page).In the third term you will also start classes in Ancient Greek, and over the summer we run a short, free intensive course in Greek to help prepare you for Part 1A.Part 1A centres on a carefully designed selection of Latin and Greek texts, which will help you develop your reading skills in both languages, and also introduce you to all aspects of Greek and Roman culture - literature, history, linguistics, art and archaeology. You will attend a range of lectures and supervisions on all these areas, and pick two of them to focus on as the year progresses.The main variety within Part 1A comes with your linguistic background. We believe that you cannot get fully to grips with a culture unless you have learnt its language: this is crucial, for example, in appreciating literature and evaluating historical evidence, rather than having to trust in another person's translation. Therefore throughout Part 1 there is a strong emphasis on developing your Latin and Greek.People on the four-year degree, who have come through Prelims, have special classes to help consolidate their Latin. Otherwise, they are now treated exactly like the many students who come for the three-year course but have not studied Greek to A level (what we call the 'Intensive Greek' programme). These students attend regular language classes by expert teachers, with the aim of reaching A-level standard in one year. All students, regardless of how much language they know from school, will also receive supervisions organised in their College to support their reading skills.Part 1B allows you to read a wider range of ancient authors in both languages, with options to choose from (such as 'Youth at Rome', 'The Iliad'). Students also continue with two of the following four areas: philosophy, history, art and archaeology, linguistics. Again you can follow particular courses within each of these areas.The final year of your degree is uniquely flexible and intellectually exciting. Here you have the chance to specialise in what really interests you the most.You can choose four options from a rich menu of topics, covering all of the branches of classics which you have met so far, as well as interdisciplinary courses which trace a topic across various facets of both Greek and Roman culture (for example how divinities were envisaged, or attitudes to sexual ethics). You can also choose one of a selection of courses offered by other faculties, such as the English faculty's course on the history of tragedy.Another popular option in Part 2 is to make one of your four choices an extended essay of 10,000 words on any topic about the ancient world. This is a fantastic opportunity to probe a subject in real depth and possibly even to do some research which is truly innovative.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

If you have any additional questions about the course, please contact one of our Access and Outreach Officers at schools.liaison@classics.cam.ac.uk.Information about finance, international applications etc. can be found on the University’s admissions pages. As undergraduate applications are handled by the colleges, you are also advised to consult their individual websites. 1. Why should I study Classics? Classics is the study of two of the most interesting cultures in world history - those of ancient Greece and Rome - and of those they came into contact with. Understand how languages work by studying Ancient Greek, Latin and general linguistics. Learn to appreciate and critique the great imaginative achievements of Greek and Latin literature and art. Sharpen your argumentative toolkit by studying their philosophy. Learn to interpret the historical and archaeological sources for almost 2000 fascinating years of Mediterranean history. Furthermore, Classics also embraces the study of how the Classical world and its ideas have been received by more recent societies, right up to the present.This breadth makes Classics at Cambridge vibrant, challenging and fun. The all-round mental training also makes our graduates highly marketable (see question 2)!Back to top 2. What careers do those with a Classics degree go on to? Few degrees offer the same opportunities for acquiring advanced skills in languages, analytical thinking, essay-writing, visual analysis, critical sensitivity, spotting a biased source at a hundred paces, and so on. No wonder that Cambridge classicists are amongst the most employable graduates in the country. Our students have gone on to law, journalism, film and television, banking, consultancy, marketing, museum and gallery work, teaching and academia. In the Guardian’s last two University Guide to Classics, Cambridge came top in the country for ‘Career Prospects’. We have put a long list of transferable skills which classicists acquire here.Back to top 3. What courses do you offer? We offer two Classics courses at Cambridge: a 3-year course, normally for those who are studying Latin up to A level or equivalent, and a 4-year course for those who aren’t. This second course is for a range of people: those with no Latin and Greek at all, and those who will have e.g. GCSE or AS level. On arrival, each student is taught at their particular level. All undergraduates study both languages, and can choose from the full range of optional courses which are designed to give an excellent grounding in all aspects of the Classical world. Those on the 4-year course do a preliminary year in which they focus on learning Latin. In their second year they then join the new in-take of 3-year course students and both groups will follow the same course structure. (Follow this link for more detailed information.)Back to top 4. Can I study Classics with another subject? The Classics course is wonderfully diverse in its own right and offers the opportunity of borrowing a paper from another Faculty (e.g. the Tragedy paper from the Faculty of English, or Metaphysics from the Faculty of Philosophy) in the final year. You can, however, also combine study of either Latin or Greek language and culture with a modern language. For this combined degree, see the relevant Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages webpage.Back to top 5. Can I study Classics if I have never studied Latin and Greek before? Absolutely! You can do our 4-year degree. The course is designed to ensure that you will have all the same opportunities as those taking the 3-year course.Back to top 6. I haven't studied either Latin or Greek: how do I know that I'll be good at them? You might well have enjoyed a modern language like French or Spanish at school. But if you haven't had the chance to study any languages, or if you are still uncertain, you can always sign up for one of our open days, including a free annual taster day specially for students in your situation. These are advertised on the Events page.Back to top 7. Will I be at a disadvantage if I have not studied Ancient Greek? No. The majority of students on the 3-year course do not have A level or equivalent Greek, and many have none. The course is designed to give everyone the language support they need, with special classes for those who are new to the language. The aim is to provide every student with good Latin and Greek by their final year, regardless of prior experience.Back to top 8. What should I do if I've got A level (or equivalent) Greek but not Latin? Normally the Faculty will ask you to take the four-year course. If there are circumstances which make it appropriate for you to take the three-year degree, arrangements for the necessary Latin language teaching can be made within the Faculty. Such candidates will be identified by the Faculty at the admissions process. Directors of Studies will negotiate with the Faculty concerning the most suitable provision, so it may be worth contacting in advance the Director of Studies for the college to which you are applying: see the list here.Back to top 9. What subjects will prepare me best for a Classics degree? If you want to take the 3-year degree, you will almost certainly need Latin A level (or equivalent); if your school offers Greek or Classical Civilisation, they are useful too. Any subject that calls for the capacities needed in a Classics degree, such as writing essays, criticising literature, learning languages, and handling historical evidence, would be useful preparation. However, our degree is designed to provide the training you need when you get to University. In the admissions process, what matters most is not that you've done particular subjects at school, but that you demonstrate a real desire to study our degree. That might involve reading beyond your set texts, or volunteering on a local archaeological dig, or any number of other activities. A levels in apparently unrelated subjects such as Maths are great, as long as you can persuade us that Classics is your next step.Back to top 10. Am I disadvantaged if I decide to take a gap year? No. However, if you have already done some Greek and Latin, it will be very important to keep these up over the course of the year.Back to top 11. Does Cambridge welcome mature students on its Classics courses?Yes. At any given time we will have several mature undergraduates in Classics.A mature applicant is one who will be aged 21 or over at entry. Mature candidates can apply to any college that admits undergraduate students, but there are also four colleges that only admit mature undergraduates and specialise in catering to the needs of mature students: Hughes Hall, Lucy Cavendish, St Edmund’s and Wolfson. Candidates applying to a non-mature college will find themselves competing for places with non-mature applicants. It is recommended that prospective mature applicants get in touch with one of the mature colleges to ask for further advice on the admissions process, even if they decide in the end to apply to a non-mature college.Mature candidates can apply in October, i.e. at the same time as all other applicants, and are advised to do so if they possibly can. However, there is also a further admissions round in March for mature candidates at the mature colleges only.Candidates who already hold a degree at another university, or who would hold one by the time of entry, can apply for the Affiliated Degree: see here.For further information about applying as a mature student, see here.Back to top 12. What are the entry requirements for your courses?Classics (3-year) Greek or Latin at A level (or equivalent) is an essential requirement for the Classics (3-year) course. Almost everyone who takes the three-year course has Latin A level, but this is not an absolute requirement (see question 8).Classics (4-year)  While GCSE Latin or Greek or A level Classical Civilisation are useful, no specific subjects are required for the Classics (4-year) course. See question 9.Back to top 13. What is the standard offer? The standard offer for a place on the Classics course is A*AA at A level, 40 points in the IB, or D2-D3-D3 at pre-U, but these are not set in stone. Offers are made on the basis of individual students, taking into consideration their ability and potential. For more information about admissions, including applying with an Access to HE Diploma or from abroad, or about the Special Access Scheme, see the University admissions pagesBack to top 14. How will I be taught? This question is answered in detail on this page.Back to top 15. Is there a lot of language work on the course? Yes: we believe that studying Latin and Ancient Greek is integral to gaining a complete understanding of the classical world. It will be hard work, but ultimately very rewarding. Our aim is to enable you to read ancient sources independently, whether for literary, historical or philosophical purposes. Most students have weekly supervisions and/or classes in language throughout their first two years.Back to top 16. Will I have the opportunity to travel and do fieldwork? Yes. The Faculty offers opportunities every summer for students to go on a dig in the UK or abroad, and there are numerous travel grants available, including prizes for those students who perform well in their exams. In past years our students have been on digs in Yorkshire and Italy as well as on trips to Troy, Carthage and Greece. We also run an annual exchange programme with Classics students in Munich.Back to top 17. Which college should I apply to? Much of your teaching (e.g. all lectures) will be organised by the Faculty, and you will receive the same quality of teaching regardless of which college you are at. So you should make your choice of college on other grounds. Do you want to belong to an old college, or a new one? A college for women only, or one that is mixed? A large college, or a small one? Different people, quite properly, have different tastes and preferences in these matters. College websites (see the links here) will give you the information to help you decide for yourself. If you don’t mind which college you join, then you can make an open application.Regardless of which college, if any, you initially apply for, you will have the same chance of getting into Cambridge: all applicants who are called for interview will also get the chance to shine at a second college (see question 19), and there is a ‘pooling system’ (explained here) designed to ensure that deserving applicants to oversubscribed colleges are considered by other colleges, and that the best-qualified applicants all get places.Back to top 18. What should I put in my personal statement? There is no set rule for this. The personal statement is your opportunity to tell us about yourself and your interests. Your hobbies and achievements are worth mentioning, but are not as important as why you are interested in Classics. Be prepared to talk about your personal statement in an interview – if you write that you loved reading the Iliad, we may well ask you why. Questions such as this enable us to better understand your intellectual motivation and how you approach a subject.Back to top19. What happens in the interview process? If you are invited for an interview, you will be interviewed by the college to which you have applied (or been allocated, if you have made an open application) and by a second college selected by the Classics Faculty. All our applicants have this second interview, whose aim is to enable good candidates to shine even if their first-choice college happens to be overwhelmed with brilliant applicants in that particular year. Each college has its own process of assessing candidates, so you might have one or two (or even three) interviews in your first-choice college; they are likely to last 20-30 minutes. The most likely starting-points for conversation will be your personal statement, your reasons for choosing Classics, any written work you have been asked to submit, and your experiences of language-learning; alternatively, you may be given a few minutes to study a short text or an image which will form a basis for discussion. Our primary concern is to assess your potential, not how much you know already. We assess candidates based on the whole application process, so if any one aspect (e.g. a written test) does not go well, you may still be successful because of other parts of your application.  Back to top 20. Can I hear testimonials from students about whether they enjoyed the degree? The majority of students love the course, drawing particular attention to the breadth of the subject, and friendliness of the Faculty, as well as to the social life. You can hear some of their views in our videos about the undergraduate degree: the 2012 video can be found on Youtube; a similar film from 2008 can still be watched here. There is a page of testimonials here.Back to top'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

Faculty of ClassicsStudying at CambridgeEvery three years a production of ancient Greek drama is staged in Cambridge, in the original language with English surtitles. The show has professional direction and design, and student actors and crew. Teachers and students are very warmly encouraged to attend this exciting and unusual opportunity to experience Greek drama, and recent productions have been almost totally sold out. For some, the experience may even set in train a desire to apply to Cambridge and participate in a future play! The next Greek Play will run at the Cambridge Arts Theatre from 12 to 15 October 2016, and will be a double bill of Sophocles’ Antigone and Aristophanes’ Lysistrata. The production is led by the same team that created the acclaimed Agamemnon in 2010 and the double-bill of Prometheus Bound and Frogs in 2013, with director Helen Eastman and an original musical score by Alex Silverman.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

We send out details of our in-house summer school to students when they are offered a place.Full details and costs of the Bryanston Greek Summer School are available from the JACT website. The summer school runs a bursary scheme for Cambridge offer-holders to help with costs and some colleges may also offer financial support.These courses are very important and also very good fun. As well as introducing or consolidating the basics of the language, or taking you further if you have already done some of the languages, they are a great place to meet other students who will be in the same year at Cambridge or indeed at other universities.If for some unavoidable reason it is really impossible to attend the relevant course, it is possible to make alternative arrangements, by either going to another summer school or organising roughly 30 hours of private tuition, but these arrangements must be agreed by the Director of Studies in the relevant college and the Senior Language Teaching Officer in the Classics Faculty.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

All students in Classics benefit from tuition which is organised centrally by the Faculty and, on a more individual basis, by the college. Colleges also provide you with a Director of Studies in Classics, who will help you maximise your potential. (You can find out who directs studies at a particular college here.)This variety of provision allows us to offer a unique level of care and flexibility. Lectures are offered on all parts of the course as well as in some areas that cut across disciplines, while classes (especially in Part 2) allow you to debate issues and formulate your own arguments.Likewise, throughout your degree course, college (or “supervision”) offers you the chance to study the ancient world in depth, often emphasising a different angle from the lectures. The format of supervisions varies with the supervisor. Most often, you will write an essay in advance and discuss it with your supervisor and one or two other students. There is a real opportunity to work on each individual’s intellectual development. Supervisions train you to think critically and independently.In addition to lectures and seminars, the Classics Faculty houses the Museum of Classical Archaeology on its first floor. This contains one of the finest collections of casts of classical sculpture in the world. It also has an excellent pottery collection. These are regularly used in art and archaeology teaching. Moreover, students taking archaeology courses can sign up to visit or even help excavate a variety of sites, both in Britain and the Mediterranean.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

I think it is fairly safe to say that such a mix is unique to Classics. And the crowning glory of the four-year course, is that you learn two languages, in two years, from scratch, taught by world experts. As a 6th former making my university applications, I wondered if I was the right 'type' for Classics, but now I realise there's no such thing. With a willingness to learn, a passion for the ancient world, and the amazing support you receive at Cambridge, the four-year course can give you access to so many things you've never had the chance to study before. I can't pretend it's not a challenge, but it’s definitely an enjoyable one.Kerry Higgins is also on the 4-year course. She says: Studying the 4-year course at Cambridge has opened up a whole new world to me. Literally. It's challenging, but the course really is something unique and one to be proud of studying. You get the opportunity to study Latin and Greek to the same level as people who've been doing it for years. It's so rewarding for these ancient texts, previously inaccessible, to unfold before your eyes as you gradually get a grip on the language. But you don't just get that: art and architecture, philosophy, philology and history are also all wrapped up into one little/HUGE Classics bundle (as I said: challenging!). You'll sit down one morning and translate Plato's concept of the soul, then next you'll be panicking about dropping the ancient Mycenaean pot that's in your hands! It really is an incredible, fascinating course and something I never thought I'd be doing. And your teachers give you all the support you need.Since they are at the same college, Natalia Kim and Emily Schurr are regularly supervised together. They write: Supervisions have been the most rewarding part of our academic experience of Cambridge. You get a chance to voice your own opinions about issues raised in the lectures - it's a really important thinking process that prevents you from just writing down what other people think. It's also essential to have a balance of contribution between the supervision partners - then you can really get a debate going.Tom Cheshire took the 3-year degree. These were his thoughts at the beginning of his second year: As daunting as starting at Cambridge seemed - especially after a gap year – there was so much to do and find out, and so many people to meet, that there simply wasn’t the time to feel intimidated. It was only in the winter holidays that I could take stock and reflect on one of the most enjoyable terms of my life. Everyone quickly finds something in the course that appeals to them in particular and you’d be amazed at how much you learn over a year, especially considering that in our very first ancient history lecture the majority of us couldn’t locate Athens on a map!Naomi Hatton was among the first cohort to graduate from the four-year course. She writes: The four-year course in Classics has been the most exhilarating thing I have ever done. I had long been obsessed with the classical world but - having done no Latin or Greek before - I sometimes found it a real challenge. The four year course, and the opportunity it has provided to learn the Classical languages, has completely redefined and expanded my knowledge of the Classical world. Anyone who has not had the opportunity to study Latin and Greek at school but loves Classics should feel confident that, although challenging, this course is fun, stimulating and achieves real results. The value of the course is reflected in the fact I will be staying at Cambridge to do the Classics MPhil!'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

Without Latin no one can properly study the evidence for European history up to that time.Ancient Greek Greek is the oldest European language still spoken for which records survive. Many modern genres (e.g. tragedy, comedy, history, lyric) were founded by the Greeks.Ancient culture We offer a high-powered training in Latin and Greek language to make them gateways to the whole of the ancient world. So much in ancient culture stimulates thought about matters which are acutely relevant today. Here are some examples.Don’t imagine that the world of the Greeks and the Romans occupied only a very restricted space and time-span. The Romans came to dominate the whole of western Europe. And a well-trained classicist is able to read Greek literature written between 700 BC and AD 600 - that's 1,300 years, longer than from today to Alfred the Great!The Classical TraditionAnd Classicists don’t just study and teach the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean. What makes Classics special is in no small part the classical tradition – how Greco-Roman antiquity has continued to remain a significant point of reference and departure throughout the centuries, from late antiquity to the present day – in virtually every cultural sphere, including art and architecture, language and literature, and politics and thought.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

We ask for all submissions to be in electronic format, as a suitably anonymised Word document or pdf file, sent on disk or as an email attachment to the Editors (ccjeditors@classics.cam.ac.uk).Contributors are advised to retain a copy of the paper.Submission of a paper is taken to imply that it has not been previously published and that it is not being considered for publication elsewhere. Authors of articles published in the journal retain copyright.Submissions will be sent to anonymous referee(s) whose comments and recommendation will then be conveyed to the author by the editors. Authors should not include their name or any references which may identify them to the reviewer on the typescript.PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTSAuthors are asked to conform to the journal’s house style, detailed here (pdf document).SUPPLEMENTSPCPS and CCJ supplements are occasional publications in the form of academic monographs or collected papers. Proposals for supplements are welcome, and should be sent to Dr Christopher Whitton, Emmanuel College, Cambridge, CB2 3AP, United Kingdom. Email: clw36@cam.ac.uk.When judging proposals, the editors will look primarily to academic merit, considered in terms of (i) the quality of the research and writing, and (ii) the likely appeal to a wide, international market. Supplements can deal with any area within Classics, defined in the very broadest terms (including the reception of the Classical world and methodologies). Work at the cutting edge of the field in question is particularly invited, but more traditional work will not be discriminated against. It is unlikely that in the future CCJ will be in a position to publish Festschriften, tributes, PhD theses, or bare conference proceedings. Dr Whitton would be happy to discuss projects informally.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

Sessions consist in an approx. 45-minute presentation by an invited speaker, followed by questions and discussion. The talks, which can cover any aspect of the reception of the ancient world, are designed to appeal to a wide audience and interested parties from any Faculty are warmly encouraged to attend. There is usually the opportunity for a drink with the speaker in a social setting afterwards as well.For further information, or to express interest in giving a paper, please contact the series chair: Dr Maya Feile Tomes(mcf37@cam.ac.uk)  TUESDAY 28th FEBRUARY 2017*Please note that this is a special event organised in collaboration with the Modern Greek Seminar*"Antony and Cleopatra and Cavafy"Dr Anthony Hirst5.15pmRoom G.21, Faculty of ClassicsAbstract:This presentation examines C. P. Cavafy’s interest in Shakespeare (which perhaps dates from Cavafy‘s early teenage years in England) and focuses on the Alexandrian Greek poet's adaptations, in several poems, of elements of Shakespeare's Alexandrian play, Antony and Cleopatra. Behind this play, of course, lies Thomas North's translation of Plutarch's Life of Marcus Antonius; and in his Antony-related poems (and others) Cavafy also draws directly on Plutarch, short-circuiting what is elsewhere the tortuous linguistic journey from Plutarch's Greek prose through Jacques Amyot’s French translation of Plutarch and North's English translation of Amyot (both sixteenth-century) to Shakespeare's seventeenth-century transformation of North's text into an English verse drama, and back to Greek in the twentieth-century poetry of Cavafy.ALL WELCOMEFor further details about this event, please contact Maya Feile Tomes (mcf37@cam.ac.uk) CCRSS or Dr Liana Giannakopoulou (ag585@cam.ac.uk) at the Modern Greek Seminar. -------------------------------------------------------------- TUESDAY 14th MARCH 2017Richard Thomas (Harvard University)Why Bob Dylan Matters: Becoming a Classic5.15pmRoom G.21, Faculty of Classics--------------------------------------------------------------THURSDAY 4th MAYTschernikovsky’s Songs of Anacreon: Translation as Cultural StrategyProf. Patricia A. Rosenmeyer(University of Wisconsin-Madison / Visiting Fellow, Clare Hall)5.15pmRoom G. 21, Faculty of ClassicsAbstract:In 1920, the Greek Anacreontics were translated into Hebrew by the Jewish Russian poet Shaul Tschernikovsky. His Anacreontics were part of a larger literary project including translations of Homer, Aeschylus, Shakespeare, and Goethe, among others. For Tschernikovsky and his contemporaries, the Anacreontics seemed to represent a kind of universal mark of high culture and civilization. In the introduction to his translation Shirei Anakreon (Warsaw 1920), Tschernikovksy wrote: “It is impossible to find a cultured nation whose body of literature does not include those poems that are known as the ‘Anacreontics’”. Why did the Anacreontics in particular appeal so strongly to this poet? How did he go about translating the Greek verses into a language that was precariously balanced between an over-determined written past––the language of the Bible––and an imaginary spoken future: the modern Hebrew of a Zionist homeland? I argue that the Anacreontics functioned as a kind of passport to high culture at a time in history that was particularly fraught for Jewish European intellectuals. ALL WELCOME  'Plautus' Amphitruo in Brazil and Spain: (post)modern receptions'Dr Rodrigo Tadeu Gonçalves (Universidade Federal do Paraná, Brazil)TUESDAY 1ST NOVEMBER 2016 5.15pm, Room G.21, Faculty of ClassicsALL WELCOMEAbstract:This talk will examine two fascinating yet little-known (post)modern receptions of Plautus' Amphitruo: Guilherme Figueiredo's Um Deus Dormiu Lá em Casa ("A God Slept Here", Brazil, 1949) and Alfonso Sastre's Los Dioses y Los Cuernos ("The Gods and the Cuckolds", Spain, 1995). The talk will consider the major features of these receptions and their relations with cultural, literary, dramatic and political contexts, focusing on their recovery of important metatheatrical effects of Plautus. Figueiredo's play is a radical rewriting in which the gods are absent and in which the mortals imitate the gods imitating themselves, putting into perspective the possibility of the myth in a postmodern dramatic setting. In his turn, Sastre's work accumulates layers of self-awareness by mixing the process of reception through translation while destabilizing the ontological nature of the resulting text: the play is by both Plautus and Sastre at the same time.Speaker biography:Rodrigo Tadeu Gonçalves is Professor of Classics at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) in Brazil, having received his PhD from the same institution and completed his postdoctoral research at the Centre Léon Robin, Paris (ENS-Sorbonne-CNRS). His recent work deals with poetic and rhythmic translations of the classics, the reception of Roman comedy (especially in Brazil), and the philosophy of language and translation. With Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Rodrigo has recently published Performative Plautus: Sophistics, Metatheater and Translation, providing a theoretical and philosophical framework for the analysis of Plautus within a performative and philosophical perspective on language and theatrical performance. He is currently working on a full hexametric translation of Lucretius’ De Rerum Natura.   DR REBECCA LÄMMLE (University of Basel / University of Cambridge) 5.15pmRoom G.21Dr Rebecca Lämmle is lecturer in Greek Literature at the University of Basel and Visiting Scholar at the Faculty of Classics in Cambridge. She is also the holder of an advanced postdoctoral fellowship from the Swiss National Science Foundation (awarded 2015). She is best known for her work on Greek satyr play (e.g. Poetik des Satyrspiels, Heidelberg 2013) and is currently writing a book on Poets and Philosophers in the Underworld, the first instalment of which focuses on comical and satirical traditions in ancient Greco-Roman literature.Abstract:  This paper deals with the canonisation of Greek Tragedy and various resonances of this process in later literature – particularly in the work of the German writer, poet, publicist, literary critic, translator and classical scholar Christoph Martin Wieland (1733-1813). For both poets and their audiences, exposure to the poetic achievements of the past may result in the following symptoms: moderate to blind admiration, anxiety, misreading, parrotism (most common), fetishising, idolatry, inferiority complex, irreverence (common), abuse, mania, necrophilia (less common), suicidal tendencies (rare cases). My main interest will be the coincidence of these symptoms in the so called ‘Abderite disease’ (ἀβδηριτικὸν πάθος), an epidemic of acute Classicism first caused by the performance of Euripides’ Andromeda in the theatre of Abdera at an unknown date. Dr Adam Goldwyn(North Dakota State University) 5.15pmRoom G. 21, Faculty of ClassicsALL WELCOMEPlease note that this event will be held on a Tuesday - not Thursday.Dr Adam Goldwyn is Assistant Professor of Medieval Literature and English at North Dakota State University, specialising in the reception of Classical Greek literature, particularly in Byzantium and the Middle Ages. From 2011-2013, he was a post-doctoral researcher in Byzantine and Greek Studies at Uppsala University (Sweden), also spending time at the Swedish Institute in Athens. He is editor of The Trojan Wars and the Making of the Modern World (Uppsala: 2016) and co-translator of John Tzetzes' Allegories of the Iliad (Harvard: 2015). In the coming term he will be Visiting Professor in the Department of Classical Philology at the University of Silesia (Katowice, Poland), to which we owe his presence in Europe and, hence, the opportunity for this talk at the CCRSS; next year he will be a research fellow at Dumbarton Oaks, Harvard's Center for Byzantine Studies in Washington, DC.  Abstract:Translation in the Middle Ages, as today, is not simply a philological issue of transferring words and phrases from one language to another.  It is also, inevitably, a transferring of one culture and ideology into another. The twelfth century Roman de Troie of Benoît de Sainte-Maure offers an opportunity to examine this truism with regards to Classical reception in the Middle Ages. This paper will compare Benoît’s treatment of the meeting of Jason and Medea with the same scene in five translations: Ο πόλεμος της Τρωάδος, an anonymous Greek translation of the 13th century; Guido delle Colonne’s Historia Destructionis Troiae, a Latin translation of 1287; and three versions of the tale which use Guido as their source: the anonymous Catalan Cronica Troyana and the anonymous Middle German Trojanische Krieg, both of the 14th century; and the Englishman John Lydgate’s Troy Book of 1412-1420. An examination of these texts alongside the often elaborate manuscript illuminations that accompany them will demonstrate the ways in which six male authors condemn this most confounding of mythological women with various levels of misogynistic vitriol for her forthright expressions of sexual desire, her heretical use of black magic, and her lack of rational self-control. As a woman, a pagan, and a foreigner, Medea is a thrice-marked other, and her treatment over time and across cultures by several authors all producing different translations from the same source material is therefore illustrative of differing cultural attitudes towards these three aspects of her character.  Maya Feile Tomes  (University of Cambridge)5.15pmRoom G. 21, Faculty of ClassicsALL WELCOMEAbstract:  This paper will explore ways of reading early modern Neo-Latin texts written in, or about, (Hispano-)America during the Spanish occupation and how those ways might (or might not) be made to speak to the efforts and aims of the postcolonial project more broadly. The focus will be on the reception of Virgil's Aeneid, and the epics in question will be tested as sites of overlap and intersection between literary-critical reading strategies familiar to classicists and those familiar to Latin Americanists and other early modernists more broadly. Maya will welcome feedback and contributions from a wide range of perspectives and disciplinary backgrounds. Professor Duncan Kennedy(University of Bristol)5.15pmRoom G. 21, Faculty of ClassicsALL WELCOMEAbstract:Perhaps the most interesting recent venture to exploit the narratological model of metalepsis is Christopher Nolan’s 2010 movie, Inception. Three distinct narrative levels ‘down’ (the van chase; the tilting hotel; the snow-fortress/hospital) are presented as dreams and dreams within dreams, with a fourth, limbo or unconstructed dream space, below that. Metalepsis becomes a ‘diegetic concept’ within the movie (and is visually represented as a cartoonish machine that, complete with large button, enacts the metaleptic jump). The orchestrator of these embedded narratives is Cobb, together with the team he has assembled, and the plan is, at the instigation of a business rival Mr Saito, to insert an idea (breaking up his father’s business empire after his death) into the mind of Robert Fischer within these dreams in such a way that it will seem to have occurred spontaneously to him as the right thing to do (‘inception’ in the movie’s terminology). The narrative frame for these embedded dreams is a flight from Sydney to Los Angeles, during which Cobb and his team have placed themselves and Fischer in an induced sleep. The movie ends on arrival in LA with the apparent success of Cobb’s plan, and with Cobb’s longed-for re-union with his children, but at this point Nolan introduces a metaphysical conundrum characteristic of his plots: as Cobb goes out into the garden to see his children, the camera focuses in on the spinning top which he has used as a ‘totem’ to ensure himself that he is not ‘within’ a dream. Before we know whether the top will fall, Nolan cuts to black, generating a trope for the moment metalepsis gives way to metaphysics. Is this level, to use a crude term, Cobb’s ‘reality’, or is he within a dream (his own or someone else’s)? One could happily discuss the metaleptic strategies of Inception at length, but this is not my plan; it is rather to accept the movie’s challenge to relate metalepsis and metaphysics. Cut to black. For many (though the crucial question may be: for most…or for all?) who inhabit the world of empirical experience, that world is not ‘reality’, which rather lies at one level removed. Thus they might see themselves as characters ‘within’ some grander plot. The locus classicus for this is of course Virgil’s Aeneid, and (as in Inception), metalepsis is a diegetic concept, troped as particular manifestations of narrative: in telling the story of Rome’s history and empire, the Virgilian narrator seeks to descry the master narrative of Fate or History, personified in the figure of Jupiter the narrator, and accessed by the human characters through various modes of supernatural revelation (dreams, prophecy, oracles). But one might also see this (as I have argued in Antiquity and the Meanings of Time [2013]) in providential (personified) or quasi-providential (non-personified) explanation, such as Augustine’s City of God, Marxism, or Fukuyama’s ‘end of History’; or the ‘Invisible Hand’ of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, or Hegel’s Reason. If these can be accounted ‘metaleptic’, what about the Platonic appeal to the world of the Forms? The Forms that even Socrates himself can do no more than ‘dream’ of (e.g. Republic 533b6-c3, but often elsewhere; a metaleptic trope that will come in for close analysis)? There is, of course, resistance to such appeals to a ‘higher’ reality: Lucretius represents Epicurus as rebelling against a religion that ‘stands over’ (super…instans, 1.65) humankind, and many would raise their eyes and stand up against equivalent modern ‘superstitions’ that similarly enjoin unthinking submission and obeisance (the Market of neo-liberal economics, perhaps, though examples from across the ideological spectrum could readily be multiplied). However, Lucretius no less appeals to another level of ‘reality’, in his case troped as ‘below’ (nec tellus obstat quin omnia dispiciantur / sub pedibus quaecumque infraper inane geruntur, 3.26-7), the unconstructed space of primordial atomic motion visible only in ‘the mind’s eye’[2]— an Epicurean idealism of matter equivalent to the Platonic idealism of form, and accessible only through an equivalent metaleptic jump. But this brings us to the metaphysical crunch-point: are all attempts at explanation or understanding metaleptic in this sense, appealing to another level of ‘reality’, another world that in some sense exists beyond what ‘appears’ to be the case? How many of us have never uttered words along the lines of ‘This is really all about such-and-such’, appealing that other ‘world’ (and perhaps oblivious of the tropes we use to access that world, or – Inception-wise – of ideas and concepts that have been historically ‘planted’ below our conscious awareness and strike us as being, just, ‘right’)? This term taken from Miklós Kiss, ‘Narrative Metalepsis as Diegetic Concept in Christopher Nolan’s Inception (2010)’, Acta Univ. Sapientiae, Film and Media Studies 5 (2012), 35-54. For all their familiarity, Daryn Lehoux has recently reminded us how unusual Lucretius’s appeals to visualize the unseen world of atoms and void are in ancient philosophical discourse: ‘Seeing and Unseeing, Seen and Unseen’ in (eds) Lehoux, Morrison and Sharrock, Lucretius: Poetry, Philosophy, Science (Oxford, 2013), 131-52. Myth, Misogyny, and Magic: Mansplaining Medea in the Middle AgesProfessor Marilynn Desmond(Binghamton University)5.15pmRoom G. 21, Faculty of ClassicsALL WELCOMEMarilynn Desmond joins us from Binghamton University, where she is Distinguished Professor. She is an expert in French and English medieval literature, and the reception of Classics in those fields. She is the author of, among other things, Reading Dido: Gender, Textuality, and the Medieval Aeneid and Ovid's Art and the Wife of Bath: The Ethics of Erotic Violence. In 2014 she was the recipient of the prestigious Rome Prize from the American Academy in Rome, enabling her to kickstart her new research project on the reception of the Fall of Troy in medieval literature. Abstract:The matter of Troy in the medieval Latin West sustains a vision of the city of Troy as ever present yet always already destroyed: a city that exists outside of time. In medieval historiography, the Fall of Troy results in the Trojan diaspora and the settlement of Europe by Trojan refugees who flee the burning city; the fall of Troy consequently makes the narrative of European history possible. This vision of Trojan ancestry as a myth of origins is often invoked to express a vision of European futurity. This paper will explore how the translatio of the matter of Troy generated its own temporality. In the absence of the Homeric epics, the matter of Troy was transmitted to the medieval West by the Latin prose texts attributed to Dares and Dictys. These texts represent themselves as the translatio of ancient Greek textual traditions and simultaneously as the material transmission of these traditions from papyrus to parchment. The vernacular itinerary of the Latin texts of Dares and Dictys create a distinct Trojan temporality. In the twelfth-century Roman de Troie, Benoît de Sainte-Maure insists that the materiality of translation practices allows the reader to participate directly in the Trojan War, while two centuries later, the visual program in a manuscript of Raoul de Presles’ translation of Augustine’s De Civitate Dei encapsulates the atemporality of Troy as transmitted by Dares. Dr Cédric Scheidegger Lämmle(University of Basel / Visiting Scholar, Faculty of Classics, Cambridge)5.15pmRoom G. 21, Faculty of ClassicsALL WELCOMECédric Scheidegger Lämmle is Visiting Scholar in the Faculty of Classics, Cambridge (2015-17). He joins us from the University of Basel, where he has wide research interests in Latin literature and ancient literary theory. His current project is the preparation of a new commentary on Cicero's De domo sua. Abstract:The reception of the female philosopher, mathematician and astronomer Hypatia of Alexandria is governed by a fundamental tension: while her œuvre has largely been lost and testimony for her life and works is notoriously thin on the ground, Hypatia’s Nachleben in Western philosophical and artistic discourse is exceptionally rich and diverse. Indeed, it may be suspected that the scarcity of ‘original’ sources has paved the way for the formation of a proper legend of Hypatia, susceptible to later re-imagination and re-appropriation. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries, especially, have witnessed the expansion and proliferation of the Hypatia myth which was called upon as an illustration (and argument) in discussions of themes as controversial as the relation of science and religion, the secular state, gender asymmetry and inequality. The richness and diversity of Hypatian reception has arguably resulted in a complex and multilayered narrative of Hypatia’s life shaped by the partisan views and agendas of the many stations of its retelling.This paper proposes to discuss Alejandro Amenábar’s Ágora (Spain 2009 | dir. A. Amenábar | screen play: A. Amenábar/M. Gil) against this backdrop. The first large-scale movie to feature the figure of Hypatia, Ágora is arguably the single most influential station in Hypatia’s recent reception. It has incited lively public debate on Hypatia’s legacy and sparked the wider public’s interest in a chapter of late antique studies previously limited to specialists. At the same time, however, the movie acutely reflects Hypatia’s previous reception. Indeed, while paying lip service to an aesthetics of historical accuracy and authenticity, Ágora not only references previous re-imaginations of Hypatia in art and literature but it also meditates on the tropology of reception more broadly: as will be shown, the plot line concerning Hypatia’s astronomical speculations is vital in this respect. Not only is Ágora’s Hypatia configured as an embodiment of astronomical learning per se but she is credited with specific experiments and findings from thelongue durée of scientific astronomy. As the movie explicitly points to this origin, it reveals the fictionality of its own retelling of Hypatia’s story and lays bare the dialectics between the obliteration and the inscription of meaning germane to all acts of reception.Dr Adam Goldwyn is Assistant Professor of Medieval Literature and English at North Dakota State University, specialising in the reception of Classical Greek literature, particularly in Byzantium and the Middle Ages.

They require that research students (that is PhD students; our MPhil has training elements already built into it) receive appropriate and relevant preparation and training both to complete a high-quality doctoral thesis in their chosen subject area and to develop a range of knowledge, understanding and skills necessary for their future employment, whatever that might be. These latter are known as ‘transferable skills’ or ‘core generic skills’ (and include items such as oral and written presentation skills, and project design and management), but that does not mean that they won’t be useful to you now: they, as well as more subject-specific knowledge, understanding and skills, will help you conduct your research, write up your thesis, and take you onto the next stage of your career.   This preparation and training takes place in a range of forums and contexts, from Faculty research seminars to national (or international) conferences, from training courses run at a School or University level to events organised by the UK Research Councils through Vitae (www.vitae.ac.uk). In order to try to guide you through this variety the Classics Faculty has come up with a basic training framework outlined below. This identifies the kinds of subject specific events and general training courses that will be particularly useful over the course of your PhD. It is up to you, in discussion with your supervisor, to determine the particular package most suited to your needs and interests, and each year you will, together with your supervisor, draw up a personal programme (or Personal Development Plan (PDP) to use the current jargon) of the seminars and courses you plan to attend, and keep a record of all those you do attend (and what you got out of them). Training should not be overlooked, or put off, you should start thinking about it now, building up the knowledge, understanding and skills necessary for your research and career, throughout your studies.In line with the RCUK recommendations we expect Year 1 research students to undergo around 10 days training over the year, and Year 2 and 3 students around 8 days, covering both core generic and subject-specific skills and knowledge. The rough shape of each year is set out below, as well as some of the training courses most appropriate to it, but this is for you to think about and plan, in discussion with your supervisor, and in relation to your specific needs and goals.The focus this year is on getting started on your research project, thinking about its shape and structure; identifying and acquiring the key research skills necessary; the various resources available; participating in seminars…(a) IT—electronic resources for research;(b) Specific research skills you may need—e.g. palaeography, epigraphy, statistics,GISetc;(c) Language training if required (see further the Language Centre's graduate training page)(d) Generic research skills—project design and management etc;(e) Core generic skills—e.g. presentation skills;(f) Research seminars;(g) Graduate Interdisciplinary Seminars;(h) Training in small group teaching.Key School/University Courses: ‘Starting your PhD’; ‘Time Management’; ‘Presenting’; ‘Starting to Write for your PhD’; ‘Supervising and Small Group Teaching’The School also offers one to one ‘Skills analysis’ sessions (a 30 minute session designed to help the participant evaluate their current skill levels and identify the particular areas they wish to focus on).    This year you might like to think more about presenting your work: to the Graduate Interdisciplinary Seminar, Faculty Seminars, and beyond (especially at national post-graduate conferences in your subject); and about developing your teaching skills; as well as consolidating and developing your research, your writing, more broadly…(a) IT—for presenting and teaching as well as research;(b) Further specific skills identified in Year 1;(c) Teaching/Lecturing;(d) Writing papers and presenting research;(e) Research Seminars;(f) Graduate Interdisciplinary Seminars.School/University courses: ‘Presentation skills’; ‘Lecturing skills’; ‘Interdisciplinary Graduate Conference’This year you might like to consider giving papers at national and international conferences; and as well as pushing to finish the thesis, you need to make plans for what happens next…(a) Publication;(b) Careers Advice;(c) Developing post-doctoral research projects;(d) Presenting at national and international conferences;(e) Research seminars;(f) Graduate Interdisciplinary Seminars.(g) Organising a Conference.School/University courses: ‘Completing your PhD’; ‘Applying for post-doctoral grants and fellowships’; ‘Editing your academic writing’RCUK Skills and TrainingCurrent national policy Cambridge AHRC Doctoral Training PartnershipGraduate Development Programme on-line calendarUniversity Skills Portal  'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

Its purpose is to help takers to identify the relevance of numismatic material to Part II thesis-topics, MPhil essays, or PhD and other research-based work, as well as to taught courses in the Tripos. Past graduate-members have been drawn from a range of subject-groups, including classical archaeologists/art-historians, ancient historians, and students of ancient literature and linguistics. No previous experience of coins is required and at least one bye-class on coin-identification and on reading coin-catalogues will be offered (19 January 2018, 16:00-18:00). MPhil students new to Cambridge may also be interested in other sessions in the supplementary (Friday) series in which topics relating principally to the four C-group Part II papers are discussed in more detail than is possible in the Thursday classes (consult the General Courses entry in the Undergraduate Courses section online). Both series will continue, if necessary, during the first four weeks of Easter Term.Recent MPhil essay-titles have been “Late Carthaginian coins of the Iberian peninsula”, “How did Rome pay its soldiers in Greece in the second century BC?”, "The coinage of the First Jewish Revolt: context and meaning", “Imperial women: Julio-Claudian female representations on coinage”, “The 874 AUC-issue and Hadrian’s coin programme for AD 121”, and “For love and honour: the deification of Faustina I”. There is, too, the option of offering a numismatic exercise in lieu of an MPhil essay; this might, for example, be a contribution to a project that has as its end a scientific catalogue of the now dispersed collection of Thomas Herbert (1656-1733), 8th Earl of Pembroke, of which a first fascicle, dedicated to the gold and silver coins of the late Roman republic, was offered in 2014.The classes will be fully illustrated and (with discussion) will run for two hours. The programme will be problem-focussed rather than a chronological account of Greek and Roman coinage (for which see, below, the Oxford Handbook) and will seek to examine the strengths and limitations of the different and sometimes apparently contradictory sorts of evidence employed in trying to understand how coins behaved in the ancient world. The course unashamedly takes the perspective of students working principally from printed sources – coin-catalogues, find-reports, and individual studies – and a primary objective will be to provide you with a critical framework for approaching such sources. The interaction of literary material, and comparative arguments will bear, too, on more general research techniques and on the way information is evaluated.General procedures will be exemplified, where possible, by reference to material related to the interests of individual class-members. They include considering what can be learnt from the way coins are made and what weight should be given to the designs that appear on them. Set pieces from previous years include a critique of a particular site-report (Coins from the centre of Rome) and the reception of Greek and Roman coins from the Renaissance onwards (e.g. The image of Alexander the Great in fifteenth century Italy). A visit to the Bank of England Museum (refurbished in 2014) and to the British Museum's Money gallery (refurbished in 2013), either at the end of the Lent Term or at the beginning of the Easter Term, will complement the Cambridge classes.MPhil students minded to write either an essay on a numismatic topic or one that is likely to draw on numismatic evidence are encouraged to contact TRV as soon as possible, by e-mail to t.r.volk@ntlworld.com. He expects to be in Cambridge at the start of Michaelmas Term when he will be available (by appointment) in the Classics Faculty for one-to-one meetings (dates will be circulated nearer the time). In addition, there will be a meeting for all interested students on Wednesday, 17 January 2018 (i.e. immediately before the start of the lecturing term) to decide course topics.Preliminary reading: P.

They are essential to our understanding of important areas of these civilisations: institutions and administration, laws, religion, crafts, prosopography, onomastics, etc. This course aims at providing a basic introduction to Greek (weeks 1–4) and Roman (weeks 5–8) epigraphy. Students will be guided in the use of basic epigraphic scholarly tools and introduced to the various types of inscriptions and their evolution through time. Whenever possible, examples relevant to the interests of the students will be chosen to illustrate the significance of epigraphic material.Suggested preliminary reading: J.

Classical Latin is available only to candidates with A- level or equivalent in Latin (Option B); Classical Greek is available both to candidates with A-level or equivalent in Greek (Option B) and to beginners (Option A). Option A (for ‘Intensive Greek’ candidates without A-level Greek) comprises:(i) GL2, a paper containing unseen passages of Greek for translation and seen passages for comment;(ii) GL5, Classical Questions (with sections on Greek Literature, Ancient Philosophy, Ancient History, Ancient Art and Archaeology, and Philology and Linguistics).Candidates may optionally offer, in addition to the above, GL6 (Greek prose and/or verse composition); see n.4, below.There is no Option A for ‘Intensive Latin’ candidates without A-level Latin. Option B (for candidates with A-level Greek or Latin) comprises:For Classical Greek:(i) GL1, a paper containing unseen passages of Greek for translation and seen passages for comment;(ii) GL5, Classical Questions (with sections on Greek Literature, Ancient Philosophy, Ancient History, Ancient Art and Archaeology, and Philology and Linguistics).Candidates may optionally offer, in addition to the above, GL6 (Greek prose and/or verse composition); see n.4, below. For Classical Latin:(i) GL3, a paper containing unseen passages of Latin for translation and seen passages for comment;(ii) GL5, Classical Questions (with sections on Latin Literature, Ancient Philosophy, Ancient History, Ancient Art and Archaeology, and Philology and Linguistics).Candidates may optionally offer, in addition to the above, GL7 (Latin prose and/or verse composition); see n.4, below. 1. If you choose Option A in Classical Greek, you must take Option B in your modern language.2. Paper GL5 (Classical Questions) has a special rubric for MML candidates, since they are studying only one of the classical languages.MML candidates may, if they wish, answer questions in any of the non-literary subject-areas of the paper (Philosophy, History, Art and Archaeology, Philology and Linguistics); but it should be stressed that there is no requirement for them to study any non-literary subjects for either Part IA or IB. However, any Part IA candidates who intend to take in Part IB the papers available in Greek and Roman Philosophy, Greek and Roman History, Greek and Roman Art and Archaeology, or Philology and Linguistics, are strongly advised to attend in their first year the introductory lectures in these subjects (as advertised under the section headed ‘Part IA Courses (Paper 6)’ in this Classics Handbook).This paper will be divided into two sections, containing:(a) questions on Greek and Latin literature;(b) questions on Greek and Roman philosophy, Greek and Roman history from c. 800 bc to ad 337, Greek and Roman art and archaeology, Classical philology and linguistics.Candidates will be required to answer three questions. MML candidates must answer one question from Section A and may answer all three questions from Section A.3. Candidates who take either optional paper involving translation from English into Greek (GL6) or into Latin (GL7) will receive credit for a good performance but will not be in any way penalized should they perform less well. Please note that these Papers are taken on the first three days of the Easter Term and not at the more normal time for University Examinations.  In general on the choice of papers for MML Part 1B, see http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/mml/ibThe option to be examined by Long Essay is not available in ancient Greek and Latin.Candidates may offer classical papers in Part IB only if they have already taken classical papers in Part IA. The Regulations are rather detailed because the combination of classical papers which may be offered in IB depends on the Options already taken in both the classical and modern languages in Part IA.

examination results will not be available until after the end of Easter Full Term. There are many possible answers to the question ‘Why learn Latin and Greek?’, but in the context of Classics at Cambridge, learning to read a range of different types of Greek and Latin is central to a programme which aims to explore and interrogate classical culture as a whole.  The connections between, on the one hand, the way a language works and the ways in which native speakers and writers express themselves and, on the other, the intellectual and cultural patterns which inform a particular society are complex and far from easy to reduce to a simple list, but direct access to these connections is both a necessary and exciting part of the study of any aspect of Classical Antiquity.One of the overarching aims of Parts IA and IB of the Classical Tripos is to foster a ‘feel’ for how Greek and Latin work, what they are ‘like’, so that translation and reading are not merely a process of mapping dictionary entries on to a text, but rather an experience of thought and expression within another culture.  Language learning provides a common core which gives coherence and shape to everyone’s experience of Classics.Because preparedness and ability in language lie at the core of your work, language is the dominant focus of the Part IA examination.  There are ‘Language and texts’ papers in Greek and Latin, testing confidence in handling Greek and Latin texts by presenting two passages which have not been prepared (so-called ‘unseens’), as well as two passages from the Target Texts (see the list under the section headed ‘Schedule of texts’), from which you have to choose one on which to offer a critical discussion.  You also have the option of doing composition from English into Greek and/or Latin in Papers 6 and 7.  Some undergraduates will have had experience of this prior to Cambridge, but others start it here; all who take this option say that it helps greatly with their command of the languages.These papers are designed to support various broader aims.  The skills you develop at Cambridge should give you the confidence to read Greek and Latin independently, outside any set syllabus.  Within the Part I course linguistic confidence will enable you to get the most, not only out of the Literature and Philology options, but also out of the study of Ancient Philosophy and History; to limit your experience of Greek and Latin texts ‘in the original’ to the particular groups you choose for Papers 5 and 6 in Part IB would be to limit your ability to pursue philosophical, historical and cultural problems: plenty of literary texts (to say nothing of inscriptions and papyri) have no accessible English translation.  Part IA and IB are importantly about learning how to learn about the ancient world and acquiring some of the main skills which will enable you to put that knowledge to best effect. The teaching for language papers falls broadly into five kinds:As far as College teaching is concerned, there are various approaches possible, and every undergraduate will experience a variety of kinds of teaching during Part I.  Such flexibility allows tailoring to the needs of individuals and small groups within Colleges; and there is scope for the special provision of particular forms of instruction where appropriate.For example, the supervisor may simply present you with a piece of Greek or Latin and then take part in an active collaboration to ascertain the sense. This exercise is designed not only so that the supervisor can see undergraduates’ processes of comprehension at work and help to refine them, but more importantly so that you can see together how the language works, how words have ‘meaning’, and how writers either close down or open up potential meanings.  Alternatively, the supervisor may ask you to produce a written translation of certain passages before the supervision, or to read a longer text from which s/he will choose a particular passage for the supervision.Whichever structure is used, it is axiomatic that ‘translation’ and interpretation are twin aspects of the same activity of sense-making.  To ask ‘What is at stake in translating a word as X rather than Y?’ always takes us straight to the heart of ancient culture, and the more you know about the cultural context of ancient literature, the more rewarding you will find the exercise of translation. The Part IA Examination consists of seven papers. Each candidate must take three papers from 1–5:In addition, candidates may take either or both of: Learning and teaching are organised around the following schedules of texts (the Target Texts):Towards the end of your Part IA year (after your examinations, but before you leave for the Long Vacation) you will need to think about and decide upon your literature options for next year. You should seek advice from your Director of Studies, and consult the ‘Greek and Latin literature (Papers 5 and 6)’ section under ‘Part IB Courses’.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

We’ll look at the theoretical inflections these variables have attracted, from antiquity to the present, with some illustrative examples from contemporary classical scholarship. The final lecture will place recent developments in theory in relation to the history of (classical) philology and the modern knowledge industry. The overall aim of these lectures is threefold: (a) to stimulate critical engagement with the basic categories on which we all rely in making sense of texts (and culture more generally); (b) to provide a first mapping of theoretical positions; and (c) to facilitate independent study of a domain of thought and practice that can seem daunting or even off-putting, but is fundamental to everything we do. All are welcome, especially the curious novice. Those wishing to get into the spirit beforehand could do worse than sample Jonathan Culler’s eminently readable Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2011). GREEK AND LATIN METREDR D BUTTERFIELD(10 LECTURES)Discussion of all the main Greek and Latin metres. These metres will be examined roughly in ascending order of difficulty or unfamiliarity, beginning with the dactylic hexameter and elegiacs, passing through the iambic trimeter and Roman comic metres, and ending with more complex lyric metres in Greek and Latin. Copies of passages discussed, and optional practice passages, will be provided. The earlier lectures, in particular, are recommended for undergraduates. Graduate students are also invited to attend, and they may find the later lectures, which will acquaint them with the less familiar metres, beneficial. Greek and Latin literature both have their roots in epic poetry, in large-scale tales of mythical events, particularly the interaction between gods and men. Such foundational texts form the spine of both the Greek and Roman literary traditions: not only were they read and reread throughout successive generations but they inspired and influenced new epic poems, which in turn helped shape their successors in the genre. In Easter Term of Part 1A undergraduates will begin reading elements of the most important Greek and Roman epic texts: Homer’s Iliad, Virgil’s Aeneid and Ovid’s Metamorphoses.For their Part IB studies, every candidate for Paper 5 must take the Greek Epic module, and every candidate for Paper 6 must take the Roman Epic module. All texts are to be read in Greek or Latin; a reduced specification is read by intensive-language candidates.Alongside the compulsory epic modules, each undergraduate must read two modules of their choice in both Greek and Latin literature. These modules, which are lectured on in the Michaelmas or Lent Terms of IB, are focused on a particular author, period or theme. Each module contains ‘Schedule A’ and ‘Schedule B’ texts: Schedule A texts are to be read in Greek or Latin and form the core texts of the module; Schedule B texts are to be read in English and provide further context and depth to the Schedule A texts. Non-intensive-language candidates for Papers 5 and 6 will be required to have read all of the Schedule A texts in Greek and Latin. Intensive-language candidates for Papers 5 and 6 will be required to have read a reduced specification of texts from the same module, with the remaining texts to be read in English. GREEK EPIC (COMPULSORY MODULE)PROF. S GOLDHILLDR R LÄMMLE(10 LECTURES)This module is designed as an introduction to early Greek epic in its Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean milieu, with a focus on the Iliad. General introductory lectures will cover various issues of Homeric diction and language, the structure of the text, the history of scholarship, notably the ‘Homeric Question’ and debates concerning oral literature, heroic values, Homeric theology, and the place of the Iliad in the larger context of Archaic hexameter poetry. Following these more thematic lectures, close readings of the individual Schedule A (to be read in Greek) and B (to be read in English) texts will then span over both Easter and Michaelmas terms. The summer should be used fully by students to prepare and revise the texts. Note that Schedule B texts are an integral part of the module.Please read as much of the set texts in advance as possible.  (Schedule A in Greek, Schedule B in English). Full bibliography will be distributed in lectures.For the Iliad, use Allen and Monro’s Oxford Classical Text. Brief commentary of the Iliad in Willcock’s 2-vol. edition (Bristol Classical Press); fuller commentary in Kirk et al.'s 6-vol. edition (Cambridge University Press). There are separate commentaries on Book 1 of the Iliad (S. Pulleyn, Oxford 2000), Book 6 (B. Graziosi and J. Haubold, Cambridge 2010), Book 9 (J. Griffin, Oxford 1995), Book 22 (I. de Jong, Cambridge 2012), Book 24 (C. Macleod, Cambridge 1982). Further bibliography and advice on Schedule B and bibliography will be given during the lectures.Schedule A:Schedule B: Hesiod, Theogony; Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite; fragments of archaic epic (in M.L. West ed., Greek Epic Fragments from the Seventh to the Fifth Centuries BC (Cambridge MA, 2003)). ROMAN EPIC (COMPULSORY MODULE)DR D BUTTERFIELDDR I GILDENHARDPROF. S OAKLEY(10 LECTURES)This course studies Roman epic from Ennius to Statius (and beyond), tracing how six authors negotiate the great themes of love and heroism, myth and modernity, Greek and Roman, and the epic canon itself. The Schedule A texts are three of the most celebrated and influential poems in the western tradition: Catullus’ remarkable epyllion on Peleus and Thetis / the abandoned Ariadne; the framing books of Virgil’s Aeneid; and the central book of Ovid’s revolutionary Metamorphoses, with its tales (among others) of Scylla, Meleager and the autophagous Erysichthon. The lectures will consider these three texts in turn and set them, with particular reference to the Schedule B texts, in the longer durée of the epic tradition.Please read as much of the set texts in advance as possible (Schedule A in Latin, Schedule B in English). Full bibliography will be distributed in lectures.Schedule A:Non-intensive: Catullus 64, Virgil Aeneid 1 and 4 (the remainder of the Aeneid to be read in translation), Ovid Metamorphoses 8.Intensive: Catullus 64, Virgil Aeneid 1 (the remainder of the Aeneid to be read in translation), Ovid Metamorphoses 8.1-546 (the remainder of Metamorphoses 8 to be read in translation).Schedule B: Ennius Annals fragments 1–163 Warmington, Lucan De bello ciuili 1, Statius Thebaid 12.Recommended editions of Schedule A texts (all with commentary): J. Godwin, Catullus poems 61–68 (Warminster 1995), R. G. Austin, P. Vergili Maronis Aeneidos liber primus (Oxford 1971).For Schedule B texts use the Loebs of E. H. Warmington, Remains of old Latin. I Ennius and Caecilius (1935), J. D. Duff, Lucan. The civil war (1928), D. R. Shackleton Bailey Statius Thebaid 8–12 and Achilleid (2003). R.G. Austin, Virgil Aeneid IV (Oxford 1955), I. Gildenhard, Virgil Aeneid 4.1-299: Latin Text, Study Questions, Commentary and Interpretative Essays (Cambridge 2012). THE EARLY HISTORY OF ROME AND GREECEPROF. M BEARDPROF. R OSBORNE(12 L: Easter, weeks 1-6)Although conventionally we tell the story of Greek and Roman history as if Rome had no history before it became embroiled in Greek affairs at the end of the third century, in fact the early history of Rome and the early history of Greece are contemporary. Not only that but writing early Greek history and writing early Roman history poses very similar problems – in both cases we have strong later traditions that relate only speculatively to the evidence surviving from the period. In this course we look at what we can know from contemporary evidence, both literary and archaeological, about what was happening in Greece and at Rome from the eighth century into the fifth century, and at what later tradition claimed and why it made such claims. The course exploits both the evidence of Greek and Roman epic that is being studied in the literary papers and a range of other poetry and prose and just a little archaeology. It serves as a background not only, in different ways, to Greek and Roman epic poetry but also to the constructions of the past in classical Greek and late Republican and Augustan Roman literature.Preliminary reading: R.

The primary questions will be the following:Science and natural philosophy: what is the difference and what difference does it make? What were the basic phenomena and explananda in cosmology, astronomy, and medicine? What was the role of observation? Topics considered will include‘Building models: theoretical models and methods of visualisation’, ‘The methods of the early Greek mathematicians’, ‘The early Pythagoreans: lore and/or science’, ‘The ancient feud between doctors and philosophers’, and ‘Plato’s reaction to early Greek science in the Timaeus’.Advance reading: G.E.R.

Following the excavations and dazzling discoveries there of Heinrich Schliemann, Mycenae became one of the most important type-sites for the archaeology of the Bronze Age Aegean, paving the way for the systematic exploration of Greece's rich pre-classical past. Known in Homer as 'rich in gold' and immortalised in ancient Greek literature as the capital of Agamemnon, Mycenae has long been vested in a legendary aura.This course examines in detail the site's history, art and archaeology from its earliest Neolithic beginnings down to its modern rediscovery. Among the aims of the course is to familiarise students with sources, methods, and tools available to us today that can help us reconstruct and understand the history and significance of a site over time.As part of the course we will explore the identity and power base of Mycenae's elite, through exploring high status artefacts, monumental architecture, iconography, and evidence for cult activity. The 'shaft graves' as well as Mycenae's palace, administration and industries are discussed, along with the few – yet highly informative – Linear B documents. The modern rediscovery of Mycenae by the western world is set alongside Schliemann's methods and practices and the impact his work had on modern scholarship, especially with regard to understanding Greece's Bronze Age past.With the Museum of Classical Archaeology holding the Mycenae Excavations Archive and remarkable collections of Mycenaean pots and sherds, one of the lectures is used for a handling session of actual objects and archival material, bringing you closer to the people in the past and to the work of the archaeologists in the present.Preliminary reading: E.

The questions will often be general and undergraduates are encouraged to deploy their knowledge of more than one text in answering them. For example, a question on ancient marital and sexual ethics and practices may allow you to deploy information acquired in reading e.g. Lysias 1, Medea, Ars Amatoria 1, Pro Caelio, and Lucretius 4.  Section B will contain about twelve questions that require knowledge of subjects studied in the introductory lectures to Ancient History, Classical Art and Archaeology, Philology and Linguistics, and Ancient Philosophy. Candidates will be required to answer three questions, one from Section (a); one from section (b); and one from either section. INTRODUCTION TO GREEK LITERATUREPROF. R HUNTER(4 L: Michaelmas, weeks 1–4)This course of lectures is designed to place the Target Texts in context and to serve as a more general introduction to the study of Greek literature. The structure of the lectures will be broadly chronological, but the focus will be on the cultural and social contexts in which literature was produced and on the varieties of critical approach which Greek literature invites. No preliminary reading is necessary, but a first orientation to the whole subject may be found in O. Taplin (ed.), Literature in the Greek & Roman Worlds (Oxford, 2000) or T. Whitmarsh, Ancient Greek Literature (Cambridge, 2004). INTRODUCTION TO LATIN LITERATUREDR C WHITTON(4 L: Michaelmas, weeks 1–4)These lectures will set the Part IA Target Texts in the context of half a millennium of Latin literature. History, culture and genre will all make an appearance, as will texts from the Part IB and Part II schedules and more. For introductory reading, try Susanna Braund, Latin Literature (2002), or dip into Stephen Harrison’s Blackwell Companion to Latin Literature (2005). INTRODUCTION TO ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY: SOCRATES AND PLATOMR N DENYERDR F SHEFFIELD(8 L: Michaelmas; 8 L: Lent)This set of lectures provides an introduction to Ancient Philosophy by focusing initially on the figure of Socrates, who was of seminal importance for most subsequent developments in Greek thought. We will look mainly at Plato’s presentation of this enigmatic figure, a presentation that is often inseparable from Plato’s own philosophical views. The lectures will consider how to read and interpret Plato’s ‘Socratic conversations’ philosophically and show how they can be a provocation to further philosophical inquiry.  The main texts will be Plato’s Apology, Euthyphro, Laches, Protagoras, Gorgias, Meno, Phaedo and Republic. Those attending the course are encouraged to read as much as possible of these in advance. A convenient translation, all in one volume, is John Cooper ed. Plato: the complete works (Hackett: Indianapolis, 1997). In the Lent Term, this introductory course will include a block of lectures devoted particularly to ‘methods and themes in Ancient Philosophy’, aimed primarily at Classicists who are thinking of taking Ancient Philosophy options at Part 1B and beyond. HELLENISTIC AND ROMAN ETHICSDR M HATZIMICHALI(8 L: Lent)How can we be happy? Should our goal in life be to maximise our pleasures and minimise our pains, or should we focus on our souls and virtue, disregarding anything to do with the body? We shall explore the rival solutions to these problems, as well as some of their implications for social values and inter-personal relationships. We will often find ourselves accessing the thought of the Hellenistic schools indirectly, through the eyes of Roman thinkers such as Cicero and Seneca, and we will be asking what they contributed to the debate. The sourcebook for this course is Long and Sedley, The Hellenistic Philosophers (2 vols. Cambridge, 1987) – see especially the sections on ‘Ethics’ under ‘Epicureanism’ and ‘Stoicism’.See also ‘Cicero: Ethics and Politics’ under Part 1B, Paper 6. GREEK HISTORY: IMPERIAL ATHENSPROF. R OSBORNE(8 L: Michaelmas)Fifth-century Athens is famous for its democracy, its empire, and its cultural achievements in art and literature. But how do these fit together? The course will put Greek and Athenian history from the Persian invasion of Greece in the early fifth century BC to the defeat of Athens in the war with Sparta under the spotlight. Did democracy drive imperialism? Did democracy depend upon the wealth that came from empire? Could tragedy have flourished without democracy? Could it have flourished without empire? Along the way we will explore Athenian identity, the city’s buildings and topography, and its social structure. This will involve the study of a range of types of ancient testimony, including literature of various genres, inscriptions and archaeology.Introductory Reading: Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War Book 1-2.65, R. Osborne (ed.), Short History of Europe, vol I Classical Greece (2000). ROMAN HISTORY: IMPERIAL EXPANSION AND POLITICAL CONFLICT FROM THE MID REPUBLIC TO AUGUSTUSPROF. M BEARD(8 L: Michaelmas)The story of Rome under the Republic (c. 509-31 BC) and the rule of Augustus, the first emperor (31 BC-AD 14) can be told both as an account of the expansion of Roman power first within and then beyond Italy, and as one of intensifying political competition and eventual crisis within the Roman state, resolved (or expunged) by the establishment of one-man rule. The course will pursue both of these themes, and will explore how they inter-relate. Topics to be covered include motivations for, and mechanisms of Roman imperialism, and its cultural and economic consequences; the institutions of Roman politics and how (or whether) they were subverted in the late Republic; and how far Augustus succeeded in providing a solution to, or exploited, the crisis. These topics will be set against the changing physical environment of the city of Rome (how far is this a marker of political change?) and a wider set of issues that extend beyond the elite (how far is it possible to see any of these changes from 'the bottom up'?). The course will also provide some historical contextualization for Cicero’s Pro Caelio, Augustus’ Res Gestae, and the first chapters of Tacitus Annals 1, which students will be reading as target texts (with a glance at Ovid, Ars Amatoria 1 and Lucretius 3).Suggested preliminary reading: M. Beard, SPQR (2015), chaps 1 and 5-9, K. Galinsky (ed), Cambridge Companion to the Age of Augustus (2005). LIVING AND DYING IN THE ANCIENT WORLDDR R FLEMMING (8 L: Lent)This course aims to introduce students to several key aspects of life in the ancient world, and various possible approaches to their study. It will focus on the rituals, rules, and behaviours associated with the key moments and stages in the life-cycle—that is birth and childhood, marriage and family formation, death and commemoration—in both Classical Greece and late Republican/early Imperial Rome, and as both similar to and distinct from each other. The intention is also to promote a broader understanding of the texture and structure of ancient life, and a familiarity with the range of types of evidence, and methodological approaches, which can be used to gain such an understanding. You might like to look in advance at some of the following: J. Evans-Grubbs and T. Parkin (eds), The Oxford Handbook of Childhood and Education in the Classical World (Oxford, 2013); R. Garland, The Greek Way of Death (London, 1985); M. Harlow and R.

Rawson (ed.), A Companion to Families in the Greek and Roman Worlds (Oxford, 2011). ART & ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE GREEK AND ROMAN WORLDSDR A LAUNARO ET AL(8 L: Michaelmas; 16 L: Lent)This course provides an introduction to the scope and potential of the art and archaeology of the Greek and Roman worlds, from the Minoan and Mycenaean societies to Late Antiquity. Lectures in the Michaelmas Term offer an overview of the questions, methods, and themes of classical 'art' and archaeology and introduce the importance and inter-relationship of these strands of knowledge for studying the Greek and Roman worlds. The Lent lectures familiarise students with the range of material culture produced by different peoples across the chronological and geographical span of Classical Antiquity. The focus of these lectures is on key sites, issues and approaches, especially of classical Athens and Augustan Rome.Suggested reading: S. Alcock and R. Osborne, Classical Archaeology, 2nd edn.

Johnson, Archaeological Theory: an Introduction (Chichester, 2010). The course is designed for those interested in the systematic study of language in general and of the classical languages in particular. It provides an introduction both to the concepts and techniques of modern descriptive and theoretical linguistics and to the ways in which these can be fruitfully applied to the analysis of Greek and Latin. There will be discussion of selected testimonia from ancient authors and analysis of passages and examples taken from mainstream authors on the Part IA literature schedules. An advanced knowledge of Greek and Latin is not presupposed, and indeed, many of those taking the Intensive language courses have found this option a very useful complement to their language learning efforts.Students may find the following introductory text-books to linguistics helpful as introductory or follow-up reading for many of the concepts introduced throughout the whole first-year course: R.L. Trask, Language: The Basics (Routledge 1999 (2nd edn.)), R. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton (eds), An Introduction to Language and Linguistics (Cambridge, 2006); V. Fromkin (ed.), An introduction to Linguistic Theory (Blackwell, 2000); E.J. Bakker (ed.), A Companion to the Ancient Greek Language (Blackwell, 2010); J.P.T. Clackson (ed.), A Companion to the Latin Language (Blackwell, 2011).Subject to Directors of Studies’ approval, supervisions will be organised centrally to complement the lectures.Those who plan to offer one or more of the Group E papers (Historical and Comparative Linguistics) in Part II of the Tripos are advised to attend at least some of the lectures for linguistics in Part IA, even if they do not intend to answer linguistics questions in Paper 5 of Part IA, or to take Paper 10 in Part IB.INTRODUCTION TO CLASSICAL PHILOLOGY AND LINGUISTICS: SPEECH AND WRITINGDR T MEIßNERDR R THOMPSON(11 L, 1 C: Michaelmas)Ancient Greek and Latin are “dead” languages, meaning that we only have written evidence for these languages. In this course, we are first of all going to explore how we can know what they sounded like. To this end, the concept of “sound” as an element of the language will be explained before discussing the sounds of Greek and Latin individually and as systems. The relationship between speech and writing is then explored: exactly how do the Greek and Latin alphabets work, and how do they come to look like they do? In this part of the course, we will look at the origin, development and spread of the alphabet and discuss how it is used by putting it in a linguistic, historical and cultural context. We will then read a number of primary sources (inscriptions) and literary texts in order to see how all of this works in practice.Students are strongly encouraged to bring pen and paper to these lectures.Recommended introductory reading:J.

ADVANCED GREEK SYNTAX (NON-IG)MR F BASSO(8 L: Michaelmas)In this course we will cover the essential topics of Greek syntax, primarily using examples drawn from your target texts. The aim is to consolidate and deepen your knowledge by seeing how Greek grammar works in practice. In each topic we will start with the basics and progress to more advanced issues, so these lectures will be of use to students of all levels of experience. As a reference grammar we recommend Smyth and Messing, Greek Grammar (1956). All Part IA non-IG students are strongly encouraged to attend. ADVANCED LATIN SYNTAXPROF. S OAKLEY(6 L:  Michaelmas)How does your knowledge of the Latin language keep pace with your broadening literary horizons and developing literary-critical skills? This course will consolidate and extend your understanding of essential Latin syntax, covering key constructions and ideas and introducing less familiar topics such as speech particles. Examples will be taken primarily from Part IA target texts, and lectures will cater to both the least and the most experienced students. For the least experience the ‘rules’ will be explained. For them ore experience we shall try to explain why the ‘rules’ became ‘rules’. No initial reading is required but, if you want to understand syntax and not just learn ‘the rules’, E. C. Woodcock, A New Latin Syntax (1959, but often reprinted), is an excellent place to start. All Part IA students are strongly advised to attend. GREEK ACCENTSDR L PRAUSCELLO (4 L: Michaelmas)Two lectures, explaining the general principles of Greek accentuation, followed by two practical classes.

Kwintner, Euripides Medea  (Bryn Mawr Commentaries 1999).The choral odes will not form part of the body of text relevant for examination. In most years the majority of students who read for the Classical Tripos have not studied Greek up to A-level standard and therefore take Paper 2. In the Michaelmas and Lent Terms the Faculty runs compulsory Intensive Greek Classes for those studying for Paper 2. The aim of these classes is twofold: first, to provide instruction in the Greek language through study of grammar, translation seen and unseen, and the reading of Greek texts; second, to help undergraduates in their reading of the texts prescribed for those taking Paper 2.In Faculty teaching for this paper, undergraduates are divided into groups (normally seven or eight); these groups are roughly graded to reflect knowledge of the Greek language. The larger sub-set of these students - those who have not taken Ancient Greek to GCSE (normally all groups except the highest) - are required to study on a pre-terminal course, before the Michaelmas Term. If you are one of these students, you will be notified of what is expected of you before the Michaelmas Term in which you arrive in Cambridge.It is important to note that undergraduates are often moved between groups as their attainment prior to arriving in Cambridge and their proficiency in the Greek language become clearer. PRETERMINAL INTENSIVE GREEK CLASSES (for pre-GCSE candidates only)MR F BASSODR R OMITOWOJUDR C WEISSDR C JACKSONTues 26th  Sept – Fri. 29th Sept 2017 (9 C: 3 per day) INTENSIVE GREEK READING CLASSES : LYSIAS 1MR F BASSODR R OMITOWOJUDR M HATZIMICHALIDR L PRAUSCELLO MR N DENYER16 C: Michaelmas weeks 1-4The following edition of the Greek text will be used in class and a copy will be provided: C.

Starting from the earliest literature written in Latin down to the Classical period, we will examine topics including the development of a Roman poetic register and different genres; the presence and meaning of Greek features (words, morphology, syntax) in Latin literature; developments in the verbal system of Latin; to what extent everyday speech has an influence on literary texts - and to what extent we can use texts as evidence for everyday speech; linguistic aspects of metre and scansion; the use (and abuse) of archaisms. The lectures will include in-depth analyses of the language of individual authors and texts, many of which will be taken from the Part IA and Part IB schedules, and all of which will be distributed in class.Suggested introductory reading:J.P.T.

Question 1, which is compulsory, will consist of nine images or passages of ancient text, given with translation, three relating to each of the topics above; candidates must comment on any three. Questions 2–10 will consist of essay-questions divided into three sections, each section containing three questions relating to one of the three topics listed above. In addition to Question 1, candidates will be required to answer two essay questions, each taken from a different section. Candidates will thus need to be familiar with at least two of the three topics. BETWEEN TWO WORLDS: FROM CLASSICAL TO HELLENISTIC GREECEDR P MILLETT ET AL(12 L: Michaelmas)There has been plenty of speculation about the emergence of self-governing, polis-states (notably, democratic Athens) in the early Greek world; rather less attention has been paid to the other end of the process: their encounters with and absorption by the great monarchies, that were the heirs to Alexander’s empire. This course will try, in some small way, to redress the balance. The implications of the transition from ‘Classical’ to ‘Hellenistic’ (both terms to be examined critically) will be explored through a range of types of testimony, including the Attic Orators, Menander, Plutarch, and a range of inscriptions. The focus of attention will shift through time and space from the polis-politics of the Athens of Lycurgus, via Philip and Alexander, to the royal courts of the Macedonian and later monarchies.Specified Texts: Plutarch, Life of Demetrios Sections 10-14, 23-27; Honours for Kallias of Sphettos (text and translation in T.

Scott-Kilvert, The Age of Alexander); Michael Scott, From Democrats to Kings. THE ROMAN EMPEROR: FROM TIBERIUS TO THE SEVERANSDR J PATTERSON(12 L: Lent)This course will focus on the very centre of power in imperial Rome, the figure of the emperor himself, from the death of Augustus to the early third century AD. One central theme will be the nature of the relationships between the emperor and other key elements in the Roman state – the Senate, equestrian order and provincial elites, the people of Rome, and the army. We will also be looking at the multiple responsibilities of the emperor – military, religious and administrative – and at the development of an imperial court; and investigating what factors lay behind the designation, in both ancient and modern times, of certain emperors as ‘good’ or ‘bad’.The following key passages from literary texts and inscriptions are to be studied, along with some specified monuments in Rome, as one important aim of the course is to set the emperor’s various activities in the physical context of the city.Specified texts and monuments:Philo, Embassy to Gaius 349-53; Josephus, Jewish War 7. 148-62;Statius Silvae 3.3.59-97; Pliny Letters 7.29; 10. 4, 5, 12, 96-7; Pliny Panegyricus 48-49; Tacitus Annals 1.72; Annals 15.44; Tacitus Histories 1.4; Suetonius Caligula 22; Nero 31, 57; Dio 69.6-7, 20; Dio 73.21.

Section A will contain in the region of 7 questions on the set text (currently: Plato, Republic 473c11–535a1). Section B will contain questions (to give a total in the region of 20 in all) covering topics falling within each of the following four areas:Candidates will be expected to answer three questions of which at least one, and not more than two, must be from Section A. PARMENIDES TO DEMOCRITUSMR N DENYER(8 L: Lent)Parmenides’ poem denies the possibility of ‘what is not’, and therefore, he thinks, also of any change and plurality. We will begin by examining Parmenides’ argument, perhaps the earliest Greek example of sustained deductive reasoning. We will continue by looking at the arguments that Zeno devised to show that those who rejected Parmenides’ argument were committed to no less paradoxical claims about the possibility of plurality and motion. Then we will consider responses to Parmenides by later philosophers who wanted to revive the business of cosmology, in particular Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and Democritus. We will consider how these thinkers approached questions such as the nature of reality and the possibility of humans acquiring knowledge of it.It is recommended that you consult A.A. Long (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Early Greek Philosophy (1999), J. Warren, Presocratics (2007), and G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven & M. Schofield, The Presocratic Philosophers (1983, 2nd ed.). ARISTOTLEPROF. G BETEGH (8 L: Lent)Dante called him ‘the master of them that know’; Aquinas called him simply ‘the philosopher’; and Plato ‘the mind’. In these necessarily selective lectures we will look at some important highlights from the thought of Aristotle, including the Categories as well as his theories on causes, soul-and-body and happiness. The Part I philosophy experience cannot be complete without an introduction to the deviser of the most comprehensive, systematic and durable philosophy ever known in intellectual history. At the same time, these lectures are also intended to supply important background for those going on to take philosophy papers in Part II. A good way to get a taste before you start is to read Jonathan Barnes, Aristotle: a very short introduction (Oxford University Press), originally in the Past Masters series. HELLENISTIC AND ROMAN PHILOSOPHY: KNOWLEDGE AND FATEDR M HATZIMICHALI(8 L: Michaelmas)This course will consider two sets of fundamental philosophical questions. (1) Can we attain knowledge of the world? If so, how? If not, why not? And what sort of life, if any, could we ever live without knowledge and beliefs? (2) Are our actions really free? Or is everything, including our own deliberations, already determined and fated? In eight lectures we will discuss how the main Hellenistic philosophical schools and tendencies posed (and, in some cases, even devised) these questions and tried to answer them, engaging in an exciting debate in which the rival positions constantly influenced and challenged one other.These lectures are intended to cover the main material relevant to this part of section B of Paper 8.Most of the main texts and translations, supplemented by extensive comments, are contained in the two volumes of A.A. Long, D.N. Sedley, The Hellenistic Philosophers, Cambridge: CUP, 1987. You can familiarise yourself with the protagonists of this course by reading at least the introduction of The Hellenistic Philosophers and the relevant sections of The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics (chs. 3, 5, 6, 7), The Cambridge Companion to Epicureanism (chs. 5 and 8), and The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Scepticism (chs. 3–6, 7, 8, 11). The monumental The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy (Cambridge: CUP, 1999) contains up to date discussions of most of the themes we will deal with (cf., in particular, chs. 7–11, 14–17).See also ‘Cicero: Ethics and Politics’ under Part 1B, Paper 6. PLATO, REPUBLIC 473–535DR R WARDY(12 L: Michaelmas)Plato's Republic 473–535 is the central section of the central work by the central figure in the history of philosophy. Republic 473 announces Socrates’ great paradoxical claim: cities and humans generally will never be free from misery until either philosophers become kings or our present rulers become proper philosophers.The following sixty Stephanus pages introduce a sequence of brilliant arguments and images designed to defend that claim. Along the way we learn what true political expertise involves and how it might be acquired. We also delve into some very basic questions about the nature of reality and knowledge.The best advance reading is the text itself. For Greek with commentary, use Slings’ OCT and James Adam's old but wonderful two-volume edition (CUP, second, revised, edition, 1963). For a translation use Paul Shorey's Loeb. On account of the dialogue's length, we concentrate on only a selection, albeit the central core; those who read the rest of the Republic, at least in translation, will be exposed to a wealth of additional exciting material, and enjoy a considerable advantage. EARLY GREEK PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCEMR N DENYER (8 L: Easter)The course will discuss the relationship between science and philosophy from Thales to Plato’s Timaeus, based on the relevant fragments of the Presocratic philosophers and sections from Hippocratic treatises. The primary questions will be the following:Advance reading: G.E.R. Lloyd, Early Greek Science: Thales to Aristotle; R. McKirahan, Philosophy Before Socrates (2nd edition); A.A.

Within this spread, however, we regard it as very important that during the Part IB years everyone should study authors who have always been regarded as central to any engagement with the literature of Greece and Rome; this is the reason why, in the first year, there is a much more narrowly defined syllabus of Target texts – Homer, tragedy, oratory, Cicero, Virgil, Ovid etc. The topics studied in the second year focus largely on texts in these same areas, but also afford the opportunity to range more widely outside the traditional canon.In each of Papers 5 and 6 two topics from a choice of four are selected for study and examination; this is in addition to the compulsory epic module in each language, taught in the Easter Term immediately after the Part 1A examinations. Each topic includes two groups of texts labelled Schedule A and Schedule B. The three sections of Schedule A constitute the ‘core’ texts of that topic, while the texts in Schedule B offer scope for further exploration. The topics are designed to have a unity either of genre (e.g. Paper 5 Topic 3 ‘The Greek novel’), or of period (Paper 6 Topic 1 ‘Cicero and Caesar’), or of theme (e.g. Paper 5 Topic 4 ‘Persians’).Non-intensive-language candidates for either Paper 5 or Paper 6 will be required to have read both texts in the Schedule A of a topic studied for examination. Intensive-language candidates for either Paper 5 or 6 have a reduced schedule that is noted in the prescriptions below.  Reading listsReading lists for Papers 5–6 lecture courses are distributed by the lecturers themselves and some may be available on the Faculty's Moodle site.The teaching and examining for Papers 5 and 6 will be organised around the following schedules of texts: Schedule A: Homer, Iliad 1, 6, 9, 22, 24 (the remainder of the Iliad, and the Odyssey, to be read in translation).IG: Homer, Iliad 1, 6, 24 (the remainder of the Iliad, and the Odyssey, to be read in translation).Schedule B: Hesiod, Theogony, Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, fragments of archaic epic (in M.L.

The weighting of the other, optional modules will be increased to the same proportion.The new examination paper for Papers 5 and 6 will consist of 5 'guided essays' (i.e. essay questions attached to passages for discussion). Candidates will be asked to answer three of the five questions: question 1 (Epic) will be compulsory, and they will choose two from the remaining four.Each question will contain an element of choice, but there will be no fixed pattern for that choice. To prepare for this examination, students must study all of their texts in the original language. The paper will be of three hours’ duration. Candidates for the Classical Tripos offering Paper 1, and candidates for the MML Tripos offering Paper GL11, must answer Section A (a choice of one out of two Epic questions), and Section B (a choice of two out of four questions from the optional modules). Candidates for the Classical Tripos offering Paper 2, and candidates for the MML Tripos offering Paper GL12, must answer Section C (a choice of one out of two Epic questions), and Section D (a choice of two out of four questions from the optional modules). All questions will be of the ‘guided essay’ type (consisting of an essay question to be answered with reference to the appended passage(s)); and all three questions answered by candidates will carry equal weight. The paper will be of three hours’ duration. Candidates for the Classical Tripos offering Paper 3, and candidates for the MML Tripos offering Paper GL13, must answer Section A (a choice of one out of two Epic questions), and Section B (a choice of two out of four questions from the optional modules). Candidates for the Classical Tripos offering Paper 4 must answer Section C (a choice of one out of two Epic questions), and Section D (a choice of two out of four questions from the optional modules). All questions will be of the ‘guided essay’ type (consisting of an essay question to be answered with reference to the appended passage(s)); and all three questions answered by candidates will carry equal weight.Credit will be given for knowledge of Schedule B texts. In each paper each question carries a quarter of the marks. INTRODUCTION TO LITERARY THEORYDR I GILDENHARD(6 L: Easter)After an introductory lecture devoted to ‘theorizing theory’, we will spend the following three sessions visiting the major ‘sites of meaning’ in literary and cultural studies: the reader, the text, the author and the context. We’ll look at the theoretical inflections these variables have attracted, from antiquity to the present, with some illustrative examples from contemporary classical scholarship. The final lecture will place recent developments in theory in relation to the history of (classical) philology and the modern knowledge industry. The overall aim of these lectures is threefold: (a) to stimulate critical engagement with the basic categories on which we all rely in making sense of texts (and culture more generally); (b) to provide a first mapping of theoretical positions; and (c) to facilitate independent study of a domain of thought and practice that can seem daunting or even off-putting, but is fundamental to everything we do. All are welcome, especially the curious novice. Those wishing to get into the spirit beforehand could do worse than sample Jonathan Culler’s eminently readable Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2011). GUIDED ESSAYSDR F MIDDLETON DR A KACHUK(4 L: Easter, weeks 1–2)These sessions will develop your techniques for discussing passages from classical texts. The structure will be between lectures and classes, with audience participation required as we consider examples drawn from the Part IB set texts. Photocopies supplied. TOPIC 1 Greek LyricDR L PRAUSCELLODR H SPELMAN(8 L: Michaelmas, weeks 5-8)This option aims at introducing students to a wide-ranging selection of Greek Archaic and early Classical lyric poetry (7th-5th cent. BC), focusing on its various genres and contexts of performance. The course will offer close readings of some of the most fascinating poetic texts of classical antiquity: Sappho’s poems on love & poetry, Alcaeus’ political songs of fight and exile, the multifarious elegiac tradition, Anacreon’s odes on eros and wine, Pindar and Bacchylides’ epinicians. Texts will be studied and analysed in detail and interpreted in their literary and historical contexts, with particular attention to diction, style and subject matter. The option will include discussions of the evolution of lyric poetic genres and dictions, the complex relationships between texts and contexts, the socio-cultural background of performance practices and some episodes of their reception.All A texts, with the exception of Pindar and Bacchylides, are taken from D. A. Campbell, Greek Lyric Poetry, Bristol Classical Press 1992. Read all of the texts from Campbell for each author in the list. For Bacchylides 5 use H. Maehler, Bacchylides, A Selection, Cambridge 2004: 38-46 (text) + 106-129. For Pindar’s Olympian 1, use D. Gerber: Pindar’s Olympian One: a commentary, Toronto, 1982 (Phoenix suppl. volume 15) and S. Instone: Pindar. Selected Odes: Olympian One, Pythian Nine, Nemeans Two & Three, Isthmian One, Warminster, 1996.A full bibliography will be provided during the lectures. TOPIC 2 Athens on StageDR F MIDDLETON(8 L: Michaelmas, weeks 1-4)Oral performance pervaded all parts of civic life in classical Athens, where speaking well was a necessary skill in the law courts, the assembly and, above all, the theatre. As citizens took to the stage, they found themselves playing out tales from the mythological past alongside absurdist visions of the present, taking on different roles as they exposed the problems and paradoxes of democratic social order. This option explores Athenian drama within the discourses of citizenship, to discuss the role of the theatre as a place for both the state and the individual to look at themselves. We focus on two plays: Euripides’ Ion and Aristophanes’ Acharnians – the story of a raped Athenian princess’s reunion with her son, the only true heir to the Athenian throne, and the story of one citizen’s radical rejection of war with Sparta. By considering these plays’ use of genre, form, religious practice and mythological inheritance we will discuss the politics they espouse: how Athens saw itself in these plays – how much we can trust that image – and what it meant to perform these works in classical Athens. TOPIC 3 The Greek NovelPROF. T WHITMARSHDR D JOLOWICZ(8 L: Lent, weeks 1–4)The novel was late Greek culture’s most stunning literary innovation. Between the first and the fourth centuries AD, when the Greek-speaking world was subject to the Roman Empire, literary romances were hugely popular amongst the educated elite from Egypt to Greece to Asia Minor. This module explores these sophisticated, risqué and exuberant texts, placing the emphasis both on their literary qualities (including their intertextual engagement with Homer and classical texts) and on their cultural significance: what can these heterosexual romances tell us about the society that produced them, and its attitudes towards identity, politics, sexuality and gender? The rediscovery of these magnificent works in the 16th century had a huge impact on European society, and ultimately gave the modern novel the central cultural role it enjoys today. Goethe called Daphnis and Chloe ‘a masterpiece’, and recommended reading it each year; Ravel composed a ballet version, Chagall painted scenes from it, Yukio Mishima wrote a Japanese novel on the theme. Achilles Tatius’ overt sexuality and literary flamboyance, on the other hand, have always generated controversy. Anyone who wants to understand the origins of the modern novel should consider this option.Achilles Tatius: use Garnaud's Budé edition or Gaselee’s Loeb for text, but for translation either T. Whitmarsh (Oxford World's Classics) or J.J Winkler in B.P. Reardon ed. Collected Ancient Greek Novels (Berkeley, 1989, repr. 2003). Longus: use John Morgan’s edition, translation and commentary (Aris and Phillips 2004), and/or Phiroze Vasunia’s translation (Penguin, 2011) / Chris Gill’s in Collected Ancient Greek Novels. For general discussions of the novels see Simon Goldhill, Foucault’s Virginity (Cambridge, 1995); Helen Morales, Vision and Narrative in Achilles Tatius’ Leucippe and Clitophon (Cambridge, 2004); T. Whitmarsh (ed.) The Cambridge Companion to the Greek and Roman Novel (Cambridge, 2008); T. Whitmarsh, Narrative and Identity in the Ancient Greek Novel (Cambridge, 2011). A full bibliography will be provided in the lectures.A full bibliography will be provided during the lectures. TOPIC 4 Persians in Greek LiteraturePROF. T WHITMARSHPROF. S GOLDHILLDR H SPELMANMR F BASSO(8 L: Lent, weeks 5-8)The Greeks’ defence of the peninsula against the two Persian invasions was arguably the most significant event in their ancient history. It was certainly the most mythicized: in art, theatre, history and song, they continually recurred to the idea of the barbarian ‘other’: violent but effeminate, despotic but weak, imperial but incapable of self-control. Yet there was much more to the Greeks’ fascination with Persia than simple rejection: Persia also became a byword for style and class, to the extent that upper-class Athenian women wore jewellery in the Persian style and the city’s architecture could reflect Persian models. This module will set Aeschylus’ great tragedy Persians and Herodotus’ history in the context of Greece’s complex mixture of revulsion and obsession with their Iranian adversaries, with a sideways look at Persia itself.For the text of Herodotus, use Nigel Wilson’s OCT; for translation use either Tom Holland’s new Penguin, the Loeb, or Robin Waterfield’s OCT. For text and translation of and commentary on Persians use Edith Hall’s edition (Aris and Phillips, 1996).A full bibliography will be provided during the lectures. TOPIC 1 Cicero and CaesarDR I GILDENHARD(8 L: Lent, weeks 1–4)Cicero and Caesar are the two most emblematic figures of the late Roman Republic. At first sight, they seem polar opposites: here Cicero, the greatest orator Rome produced, the self-proclaimed dux togatus, the author of philosophical treatises, the advocate of Greek culture in a Roman setting, the representative of republican politics; there Caesar, one of the greatest Roman generals, the ruthless power-politician, the gravedigger of the republic, dictator and tyrant. But Cicero, too, hankered after military glory and Caesar was famous for his eloquence. Both, in their different ways, facilitated the rise of autocracy at Rome. And both belong among the most distinctive prose stylists ever to write in Latin. Like complementary twins, they throw light on one another, not least since their paths crossed throughout their careers. The most intense interaction between the arch-republican and the autocrat took place after Caesar crossed the Rubicon, and the period 49–44 BC will be the principal focus of the course. We shall study the first book of Caesar’s Bellum Ciuile as a masterpiece of apologetic self-promotion and Cicero’s treatise on friendship Laelius de Amicitia – set in 129 BC, but written after the Ides of March 44 and designed in part to justify the murder of Caesar by his ‘friends’ as legitimate tyrannicide. The texts in Schedule B provide additional perspectives on the authors and the period under consideration (Catullus, Cornelius Nepos, Suetonius) and include a selection from those of Cicero’s letters that are of particular relevance to the Schedule A texts as well as the first of three speeches (the pro Marcello of 46 BC) that he delivered before Caesar.Recommended editions: Catullus: Catullus. The Shorter Poems, with an Introduction, Translation and Commentary by J. Godwin, Oxford. Caesar: Julius Caesar: The Civil War Books I & II, edited with an introduction, translation & commentary by J.M. Carter, Warminster 1990. Cicero: Laelius de amicitia: ed. with introduction, translation and notes by J.G.F. Powell, Warminster 1990; Pro Marcello: ed. by A.C. Clark (Oxford 1901) or H.C. Gotoff (Cicero’s Caesarian Speeches: A Stylistic Commentary, Chapel Hill & London 1993); Ad Atticum and Ad familiares: use D.R. Shackleton Bailey’s Loeb edition. Cornelius Nepos: use J.C. Rolfe’s Loeb (1921) and/ or Nicholas Horsfall, Cornelius Nepos, a Selection, Including the Lives of Cato and Atticus (Oxford 1989). Sallust: use L.D. Reynolds’s OCT (1991) or J.C. Rolfe’s Loeb (1921). Suetonius: Divus Iulius, ed. by H.E. Butler and M. Cary (Oxford 1927), reissued with new introduction, bibliography and additional notes by G.B. Townend (Bristol 1982) and/or J.C. Rolfe’s Loeb (1914).Full bibliography will be distributed in lectures. TOPIC 2 Seneca in poetry and prosePROF. E GOWERSDR D BUTTERFIELD(8 L: Michaelmas, Weeks 5-8)Writing (and politicking) under Claudius and Nero, Seneca the Younger is one of few Roman authors to have left a large corpus of both prose and verse literature. This course takes three contrasting samples, showcasing Seneca as tragedian, philosopher and satirist – and meditating, in three very different ways, on the ethics of life under monarchy. Thyestes is a dark and explosive tragedy on Atreus’ terrible revenge; On the brevity of life is a short summons to the truly philosophical life; Apocolocyntosis is a bawdy, outrageous skit on the ‘pumpkinification’ of Claudius. Together they present a remarkable and multi-faceted picture of one of Rome’s most influential authors.Recommended editions with commentary: Thyestes, ed. R. J. Tarrant (Atlanta, 1985); Apocolocyntosis, ed. P. T. Eden (Cambridge, 1984); De brevitate vitae, ed. G. D. Williams (together with De otio, Cambridge, 2003). Schedule B texts: Medea, ed. and transl. H. Hine (Warminster, 2000), De clementia, ed. and transl. S. Braund (Oxford, 2009); for De ira 1 and Epistulae morales 1 use the Loeb.Introductory reading: S. Bartsch and A. Schiesaro, eds. Cambridge companion to Seneca (Cambridge, 2015).A full bibliography will be provided during the lectures. TOPIC 3 Roman youthDR D BUTTERFIELDPROF. E GOWERS(8 L: Michaelmas, weeks 1–4)Adolescence, virginity, marriage, sons and daughters, mothers and fathers: youth was a rich and stimulating topic for Roman writers of poetry and prose. This topic focuses on two entertaining works from the principate: Statius’ Achilleid makes mini-epic farce of Achilles’ sojourn in drag on Scyros, while the ‘Cupid & Psyche’ episode of Apuleius’ novel Metamorphoses (a.k.a. The Golden Ass) puts a girl’s growing pains at the heart of Lucius’ comical-philosophical voyage of self-discovery. Schedule B texts extend the range from Catullus and Ovid through to Augustine in the fourth century.Recommended editions: (1) O. A. W. Dilke, Statius: Achilleid (Cambridge, 1954; reprinted with new introduction by R. Cowan, Bristol, 2005); (2) E. J. Kenney, Apuleius: Cupid & Psyche (Cambridge, 1990).A full bibliography will be provided in the lectures. TOPIC 4 Latin Love ElegyPROF. S P OAKLEY)(8 L: Lent, weeks 5-8)We shall be exploring some of the most famous poetry in Latin literature. Topics to be considered will include: reconstructing the ancient experience of ‘being in love’, both heterosexual and homoerotic (can we do this?), the manner in which the love elegists (Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, and the female Sulpicia) constructed their authorial identity and the identity of their beloved (both male and female); the attitude that these poets profess towards conventional Roman public life, politics and Augustus; the origins of the genre (with a glance at Catullus); and the end of the genre (did Ovid really kill it off?).'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

Question 1 will contain a choice of five pairs of images for comment, one pair corresponding to each of the topics taught in the year; candidates must answer on three images, no more than one image per pair. There will also be two essay questions corresponding to each of the topics taught in the year. All questions carry equal weight. LATE CLASSICAL AND HELLENISTIC SCULPTUREDR C VOUT (8 L: Michaelmas)It was only really in the late nineteenth century with the growing popularity of something like the Parthenon sculptures that fifth-century Athenian production began to dictate the pace. In contrast, the sculptures that most influenced Renaissance artists (the Laocoon, Belvedere Torso, Dying Gaul) were ‘Hellenistic’ in style, conceived in a world without democracy. This course puts their bodies under the microscope, asking how they differ from the production of Phidias, Polyclitus and their contemporaries, in bulk, beauty, politics, relationship to text, and relationship to the viewer. It will examine their function in the Greek world and their appeal in Rome. In studying form and function, it will think both about specific issues such as divinity and mortality, gender, and patronage, and about specific places such as Halicarnassus, Pergamum, Delos, and Sperlonga.Preliminary reading: Picón, Carlos (2016), Pergamum and the Hellenistic Kingdoms of the Ancient World, New Haven and London; Stewart, Andrew (2014) Art in the Hellenistic World, Cambridge; Daehner, Jens, Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World, Los Angeles; Pollitt, Jerome J.

London. US AND THEM: THE PARADOX OF THE ROMAN ECONOMYDR A LAUNARO(8 L: Michaelmas)The wondrous achievements of Roman architecture and the lavish expenditure in works of art that came along with it still lie before our very eyes. When one considers, however, that atmospheric pollution levels at the height of the Roman Empire could rival those of the early Industrial Revolution, that Roman trade extended far across the Indian Ocean and that the city of Rome harboured a population of a million people, it becomes clear that this must have been the result of quite a unique combination of specific conditions. Indeed archaeology suggests that similar patterns had not occurred before and – most importantly – were in fact not to be seen again for more than a thousand years afterwards. This awareness cannot but raise very important questions about the relationship between ‘ancient’ and ‘modern’. Acknowledging the significance and extent of actual similarities makes it even more important to properly define and explain the nature of the differences: what – if anything – made them different from us?The aim of this course is to explore this intriguing question by critically reviewing the varied array of available evidence about the structure and performance of the Roman economy – moving dialectically between aspects of economic theory, material culture and art history. As such it will look at technological development and manufacture patterns, it will place artistic and architectural practice in its broader social-economic context, it will explore the extent of trade and supply, and it will address the issue of economic growth and relevant cultural attitudes. This journey will eventually lead us to discuss to what extent and in precisely what terms the insights we derive about the modern economy can be effectively used to illuminate the Roman one… and vice-versa.Preliminary readings: K.

It aims to explore archaeological, artistic and cultural issues connected with the development of wall painting in the ancient Mediterranean, from the Archaic period to the Roman Empire. What can we learn about the classical world from the study of ancient wall painting? What contexts, audiences, and purposes did these paintings serve? By looking critically at how this medium was charged with social, religious, and political meanings, we gain precious insights into the societies that produced and consumed these works of art. Archaeological evidence from public, domestic, and funerary contexts, ranging from Etruscan and Macedonian tombs to Greek sanctuaries and Roman shops, baths and villas, and including recent discoveries in Thrace and Southern Italy, offers a variety of perspectives to reconstruct how in different historical contexts pigments were produced and traded, new painting techniques were developed, and local and foreign artistic models were adopted and adapted. The active role played by artists, patrons, and viewers in elaborating and interpreting the various meanings of wall paintings is explored also through the lens of ancient literary sources, especially Plato, Pliny the Elder, Ovid, and Philostratus the Elder. Preliminary readings: J.J. Pollitt (ed.), The Cambridge History of Painting in the Classical World (Cambridge, 2014); Gionouvès, R. (ed.), Macedonia from Philip II to the Roman Conquest (Princeton, 1994); I.

The evidence from both areas (Macedonia and western Asia Minor) are often judged in deference to better-known material from central and southern mainland Greece, with their sites and finds described in terms of departure or adherence to assumed standard forms. Studying comparatively the material culture of two such broad regions provides the opportunity to test the validity of the centre/periphery approach, as well as to consider the vibrancy and variety of these areas’ archaeologies in their own right. Four main themes will be explored for each region: 1. sanctuaries and sacred landscapes; 2. cities and urbanism; 3. coins and economics; and 4. sculpture and art.Western Asia Minor, and in particular the region of Ionia, is often relegated in studies of ancient Greece, at least in part because of the later Athenocentrism of many historical sources. In fact, 6th century Ionia, besides being the birthplace of natural philosophy and the key transitional zone in Greek–Persian/Near Eastern interaction, was a thriving and expanding economic powerhouse, which left a considerable archaeological imprint. The subsequent 5th century and its vastly reduced range of evidence by contrast offers a case-study in economic collapse. Macedonia has similarly been characterised as a transitional zone between two worlds: the Mediterranean and inland Europe. As a result, study of the material culture of Macedonia has often been pulled in two directions. On the one hand, links and similarities with southern Greece and the Aegean appear abundant. On the other, significant connections with Illyrians and Thracians to the west and north appear just as clear.This course will therefore examine a variety of Macedonian and Ionian material cultures, including urban remains, funerary architecture and grave goods, art and sculpture, and numismatics, to consider: 1. how links between regional communities and the wider world changed over time in their direction and intensity; 2. how these links influenced regional material cultures, and what such change can tell us about the lives of Macedonian or Ionian communities; and 3. to what extent the evidence suggests a distinctly ‘Macedonian’ or ‘Ionian' regional experience.Preliminary readings: E.

Most students come back from the Easter vacation of their second year with at least preliminary ideas about their choices. In the first week of the Easter Full Term the Faculty arranges advisory sessions for all Part II options, and expects you to have submitted through your Director of Studies a provisional choice of options within 10 days or so after that. The lecture timetable for the following year is then arranged in such a way as to avoid clashes between students’ nominated options among Classical Tripos papers.Within Classics Part II, you can choose to specialise within one discipline or you may spread yourself out more widely, or indeed very widely, across several.There is also a large range of papers - the O papers - offered by other faculties from which you can choose one. Please note that the Faculty has no control over the timing of O papers, and the absence of clashes with papers run by the Classics faculty cannot be guaranteed.You can also substitute for one paper a thesis of your own devising on any subject within the field of Classics. Here you will find a full statement of the relevant regulations for the thesis.All papers in the examination carry equal weight, and a thesis, if you offer one, carries the same weight as a paper. You should therefore ordinarily expect to divide your time more or less equally between your four papers, or your three papers and thesis. The Faculty advises that for each of the four this means a norm of five supervisions for which substantial pieces of written work are prepared. For some of the O papers, however, a different number of supervisions is recommended; for details, you should consult your Director of Studies, or the Academic Secretary for Undergraduate Affairs. Candidates may have to sit two exams on the same day.Part II offers you the opportunity to explore in depth whatever subjects you take on and to engage with them critically. Your supervisors will expect a greater range of reading both in classical texts and in the modern scholarly literature, and they will be hoping for more ambitious essay work. If you have not already penetrated the collections of the University Library, now is the time to do so. It will be important to prepare carefully for the relatively few Faculty lectures and classes provided for the options you have chosen, to be able to contribute to discussion as well as to derive maximum benefit yourself. In general, Part II gives you the chance to take responsibility for your own learning with the support of those teaching you.If you are starting a two-year Part II, you should note that some courses offered may change in 2018–19. Any such changes are indicated at the end of each course description. You should check this information carefully and discuss it with your Director of Studies when deciding which courses you wish to take over the two years.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

No previous experience required. The classes are open both to postgraduates and to third-year students taking D and E papers in Part II. MR T VOLK(9 C: Lent) (4 C: Easter, tbc)The course is open to students of all branches of Classics and will cater for all levels of preparation (Part I, Part II, and graduate students. No previous experience of coins is required and at least one bye-class on coin-identification and on reading coin-catalogues will be offered.Its aims are:In addition to graduate students (who should consult the Graduate Courses entry; and the Handbooks for MPhil and PhD candidates), the course has in recent years attracted both Part IA students and Part II candidates, the latter offering various combinations of A, C, D, E, and X Group papers. Part II thesis-topics on which advice has been sought since 2012-13 include the Iconography of the coinage of Ptolemy I, the Roman electoral system, Roman republican coinage and the gens, Julius Caesar, the legacy of Brutus & Cassius, libertas and res publica in late republican and imperial ideology, Augustan miniatures, the Flavians and Judaea, Trajan (three different proposals), Pompeii, N. Italy in the 3rd and early 4th centuries AD, ancient cartography, and the ventennio fascista.The classes will be fully illustrated and (with discussion) will run for two hours. The syllabus will be problem-focussed, rather than a chronological narrative of Greek and Roman coinage (for which see, below, the Oxford Handbook) and will seek to examine the strengths and limitations of the different and sometimes apparently contradictory sorts of evidence employed in trying to understand how coins behaved in the ancient world. The course unashamedly takes the perspective of students working principally from printed sources – coin-catalogues, find-reports, and mint- studies – and a primary objective will be to provide you with a critical framework for approaching such sources. The interaction of literary, material, and comparative arguments will, it is hoped assist in the development of more widely applicable research techniques and an understanding of how information is evaluated.The main series (Thursday afternoons, from 16:00 to 18:00) will be concerned with a rich mix of general procedures, exemplified, so far as possible, by material related to the interests of individual class-members. They include considering what can be learnt from the way coins are made and what weight should be given to the designs that appear on them. Set pieces from previous years include a critique of a particular site-report (Coins from the centre of Rome) and the reception of Greek and Roman coins from the Renaissance onwards(e.g. The image of Alexander the Great in fifteenth century Italy). A visit to the Bank of England Museum (refurbished in 2014) and to the British Museum's Money gallery (refurbished in 2013), either at the end of the Lent Term or at the beginning of the Easter Term, will complement the Cambridge classes.Interested Part II students are strongly encouraged to attend the main (Thursday) classes, as arguments are developed over the whole term. But it is proposed to offer a number of additional classes (Friday afternoons, from 16:00 to 18:00) beginning with a bye-class (19 January 2018) on coin-identification and continuing with sessions offering a more detailed discussion of topics related principally to the four C-group papers than might be possible in the main series. The scope and structure of these supplementary classes will depend upon intending takers' interest and availability. Both series will continue, if necessary, during the first four weeks of Easter Term.Students minded to offer a thesis on a numismatic topic or one that is likely to draw on numismatic data are encouraged to contact TRV as soon as possible, by e-mail to t.r.volk@ntlworld.com. He expects to be in Cambridge at the start of Michaelmas Term when he will be available (by appointment) for one-to-one meetings in the Classics Faculty (dates will be circulated nearer the time). In addition, there will be a meeting for all interested students on Wednesday, 17 January 2018 (i.e. immediately before the start of the lecturing term) to introduce the course and to decide the distribution of topics between the two series.Preliminary reading: P.

Candidates will be expected to answer at least one question from each section, and three questions in all.Section A will contain three questions. The first question will offer candidates a passage from the Odyssey and a passage from the Aeneid; it will invite candidates to translate and comment on one of the passages. The second question will offer candidates three passages from the Odyssey and three passages from the Aeneid; it will invite candidates to comment on any two of the six passages, translating wherever translation will help clarify candidates’ argument. The third will offer candidates three pairs of passages, one pair taken both from the Odyssey, another pair taken both from the Aeneid, and a third pair, of which one will be taken from the Odyssey and the other from the Aeneid; it will invite candidates to comment on any one of the three pairs, translating wherever translation will help clarify candidates’ argument.Section B will contain five essay questions on the Odyssey, five on the Aeneid; and two which require knowledge of both texts.In 2018-19 the scope and structure of the paper will remain unchanged.HOMER, ODYSSEYOne of the major texts of world literature, of incalculable cultural significance in antiquity and beyond, and a hugely enjoyable work of great literary sophistication. After an introduction to the themes, the lectures will proceed first sequentially through the text, pulling out and highlighting the themes, techniques and ruses of this ingenious poem; they will then turn to a discussion of broader topics, including gender, narrative, similes, language, song, performance, neoanalysis and oralism, and much besides.Please read as much as possible in Greek beforehand and bring a Greek text to each lecture. The prescribed text is T. W. Allen, Homeri Opera vols. 3-4, 2nd ed. (Oxford, Clarendon Press: 1919). You may also consult H. van Thiel: Homeri Odyssea (Hildesheim, Olms: 1991). Brief commentary: W.B. Stanford: The Odyssey of Homer (London, Macmillan: 1962); more substantial commentary: A. Heubeck (ed.): A Commentary on Homer’s Odyssey (Oxford, Clarendon: 1988–92). On select books: A. F. Garvie, Odyssey VI-VIII (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press: 1994);  R.B. Rutherford, Odyssey XIX and XX (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press: 1992). VIRGIL, AENEIDThe Aeneid is one of the giants of the western literary canon. Myth and history, love and war, triumph and tragedy – there are good reasons why Virgil’s late masterpiece became an instant cultural classic, and why it continues to fascinate readers of all hues. This course is an opportunity to study that poem in the original and in depth. Lectures will combine sequential reading with thematic approaches, situating the poem within (inter al.) the literary tradition, Virgil’s oeuvre and the Augustan ‘cultural revolution’, and charting a route through the lively critical debate that has attended it for two millennia and more. The accompanying classes (with audience participation) will feature discussion of passages and debate over modern interpretative approaches.Please read as much as possible of the Aeneid in Latin beforehand, preferably using Mynor’s Oxford Classical Text (1969); it will also be well worth rereading the Odyssey and Iliad in English. The two-volume commentary on the whole poem by Williams (London 1972, repr. Bristol 1981) is a useful aid to translation, but dated in its critical approach. Among commentaries on single books, Hardie on Book 9 (Cambridge 1994) and Tarrant on Book 12 (Cambridge 2012) best combine readability with literary sophistication. For critical bearings start with Hardie’s Virgil (Greece & Rome New Surveys, 1998) and the Cambridge Companion to Virgil (ed. Martindale, 1997), followed by Oxford Readings in Virgil’s Aeneid (ed. Harrison, 1990) and the Blackwell Companion to Vergil’s Aeneid and its tradition (ed. Farrell/Putnam, 2010). Course Directors: Prof. R L Hunter and Dr R LämmlePrescribed Texts: Homeric Hymn to Apollo (Hymn 3); Homeric Hymn to Dionysus (Hymn 7); Pindar, Pythian 1 and 3; Aristophanes, Frogs; Sophocles, Oedipus Tyrannus; Euripides, Bacchae and Cyclops; Callimachus, Hymn to Apollo, Hymn to Delos; Theocritus 26. The paper is divided into two sections. Section A contains passages from the set texts, to each of which is attached a question regarding the passage and/or the work from which it is taken. Section B contains essay questions covering the full range of the set texts and the subjects lectured on. Candidates are required to answer three questions, at least one from each section.In 2018-19 this paper will be replaced by 'Women and Greek Literature'.APOLLO AND DIONYSUS IN GREEK LITERATUREPROF. R HUNTERDR R LÄMMLE(16 L: Lent)Much of the modern conception of ancient Greece is shaped around a supposed tension between the Apolline - rational, hard-headed, political - and the Dionysiac - irrational, ecstatic, unbound. This course will seek to examine this grand vision through the close reading of particular texts, including some of the great masterpieces of Greek literature. Just who or what are the divine figures of Greek literature? Is the Dionysus of Athenian cult the same as the Dionysus of the Frogs? In what sense is tragedy Dionysiac? Can tragedy be Apolline or prophecy Dionysiac? Why is Apollo so often associated with political power? We will trace both continuity and change (why is Dionysus always both old and new?), and seek to understand the various ways in which poets sought to explain and celebrate the threatening power of divinity.A full bibliography and past papers are available on Moodle. The most useful preparatory reading will be to get on with the ‘Prescribed texts’ over the summer; any text (OCT, Aris & Philips etc) will do.To orient yourself in Greek religion have a look at J.N. Bremmer, Greek Religion (Greece & Rome New Surveys 24, 1994); W. Burkert, Greek Religion (trans. J. Raffan, Oxford 1985) pp. 143-9 (Apollo) and pp. 161-7 (Dionysos); On mythology and what myths mean: R. Buxton, Imaginary Greece (Cambridge 1994); Useful introductions to the two gods are: R. Seaford, Dionysus (London 2006), F. Graf, Apollo (London 2009);Among the various English translations of Nietzsche’s Die Geburt der Tragödie we recommend Douglas Smith, Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy, Oxford 2000 (Oxford World’s Classics); a good introduction to The Birth of Tragedy is M.S. Silk and J.P. Stern, Nietzsche on Tragedy (Cambridge 1981) pp. 166-85. Course Director: Dr E Gowers The paper will be divided into two sections. Each question in Section A will require candidates to comment on an extended passage from the set text (translating only where helpful); Section B will consist of essay questions. Candidates will answer three questions, including at least one from each section.In 2018-19 the scope and structure of the paper will remain unchanged.OVID METAMORPHOSESPROF. E GOWERS (16 L, 4 C: Lent)This course will provide an in-depth guide to reading one of the best-loved and most multi-layered of Latin poems. Ovid’s fifteen-book unbroken narrative of myth and history unfolds an alternative story of the world from the beginnings of the cosmos to the age of Augustus, binding together its fluidly generated tales according to the overriding principles of instability and change. Ovid is one of the first and most acute readers of Virgilian epic, whether through the tales of destruction and contingency that challenge the idea of the eternal city and the destined regime or through the fantastical transformations and bizarre love stories that eclipse or sideline global events. He probes the boundaries of gender and family relationships through his fascination with incest, sex-change, bestiality and thwarted attraction. He revisits tragic questions about identity, responsibility and victimization in his world of sentient plants, trapped beasts and hostile gods.There will be 12 lectures: some will be introductory and follow a roughly chronological order; some will address specific themes, such as metamorphosis and metaphor, generic creativity, allusion and intertext, narrative and rhetorical techniques; others will explore the rich afterlife of the Metamorphoses in two millennia of literature, music and art. In addition, there will be 4 x 1-hour classes offering the chance to discuss central passages in detail.The text to be used is R. Tarrant’s OCT. There is a good basic two-volume commentary on the first ten books by W. S. Anderson (Oklahoma). Other commentaries will be recommended. A good translation is by A. Melville (Oxford World’s Classics). See the following for a range of approaches to the Metamorphoses and its afterlife: F. Ahl, (1985) Metaformations. Ithaca; L. Barkan (1986) The gods made flesh.

S OAKLEY(16 L: Michaelmas)Most of the lectures will take the form of classes, with student participation strongly provoked and encouraged. They will show that it is surprisingly easy to read Latin manuscripts (esp. those of Catullus), and that the constitution of Catullus' text is surprisingly uncertain. Discussion of the textual problems of these famous poems will enable renewed appreciation of their wit: the effect will be not unlike seeing a famous painting that has just been cleaned. Extensive handouts that supplement the commentaries will be provided. Graduate students, as well as anyone interested in the history of texts, are welcome to attend the course.Suggested reading: L.D. Reynolds & N.G. Wilson, Scribes and Scholars (ed. 4, 2013), especially Chapters 1, 4, 6; G.P. Goold, Phoenix 12 (1958) 93-116. Text of Catullus: please try to use D.F.S. Thomson (Toronto 1997), now in paperback; Mynors’ (OCT 1958 and often reprinted) is not absolutely unacceptable but much less useful for our purposes. GREEK TEXTUAL CRITICISM AND PALAEOGRAPHY: SOPHOCLES, Electra 1-471DR L PRAUSCELLO(16 C (1 hr each): Lent)Greek Textual Criticism, with special reference to Sophocles, Electra 1-471. Basic bibliography: L.D. Reynolds & N.G. Wilson, Scribes and Scholars (ed. 3, 1991); H. Lloyd-Jones & N.G. Wilson, Sophoclis Fabulae (OCT 1992, 2nd imprint) and Sophoclea (1990). Edition recommended: P. Finglass, Sophocles, Electra, Cambridge (2007). After an introduction on the transmission of dramatic texts in antiquity, the course will focus on a line-by-line examination of some significant passages of the prescribed text (Sophocles' Electra). A detailed handout will be provided also for the passages not covered during the lectures. The Palaeography classes will provide an introduction to reading and studying Greek papyri and manuscripts, with special attention to Electra. They are intended primarily to supplement A4 lectures, but open to anyone interested in the history of texts.Suggested preliminary reading: L.D. Reynolds and N.G. Wilson, Scribes and Scholars (ed. 3, 1991), E. Turner, Greek Manuscripts of the Ancient World (introduction). More detailed reading list available on the Faculty website. GREEK AND LATIN METREDR D BUTTERFIELD(10 L: Easter)Discussion of all the main Greek and Latin metres. These metres will be examined roughly in ascending order of difficulty or unfamiliarity, beginning with the dactylic hexameter and elegiacs, passing through the iambic trimeter and Roman comic metres, and ending with more complex lyric metres in Greek and Latin. Copies of passages discussed, and optional practice passages, will be provided. The earlier lectures, in particular, are recommended for undergraduates. Graduate students are also invited to attend, and they may find the later lectures, which will acquaint them with the less familiar metres, beneficial.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

One is on the set text, and will contain questions on the Phaedo, the other will contain questions relating to all the following themes, with reference to dialogues other than the Phaedo: (1) forms and explanation, (2) souls bodies and immortality, (3) learning and philosophical method.Candidates will be required to answer three questions, at least one from each section.The questions will be so formulated as to be answerable without knowledge of Greek, but those with Greek will be rewarded for demonstrating appropriate knowledge of the original text.(Supervisions for this course are not centrally organized. Your director of studies will arrange for a supervisor. A typical supervision pattern is: two on the set text, two on topics from section b, and one revision session probably focused on the set text.)In 2018-19 the scope and structure of the paper will remain unchanged.PLATO, PHAEDOPROF. G BETEGH(12 L: Michaelmas)The Phaedo is a literary and philosophical classic, portraying Socrates’ final conversation, directly before his execution, as a defence of the soul’s immortality. It contains a series of celebrated but controversial arguments, as well as a myth of the afterlife, and is also a major source for Plato’s Theory of Forms.Read the text in advance, and bring a copy to the lectures. Recommended:Greek text, edited by C. Strachan, in vol. 1 of the Oxford Classical Text of Plato (Oxford 1995), or in the edition by C.J. Rowe (Cambridge 1993), which also has a very helpful commentary.English translation in D. Sedley and A. Long, Plato, Meno and Phaedo (Cambridge 2011), or in D. Gallop, Plato, Phaedo (Oxford 1975). The latter includes an excellent philosophical commentary.Further reading, and analytic handouts, will be provided at the lectures. PLATODR R WARDY(12 L: Lent)These lectures will address issues in Plato’s logic, epistemology and metaphysics by exploring various dialogues including the Parmenides, the Euthydemus, the Cratylus, and the Sophist. Central themes will include the nature of language and dialectic, the possibility of falsehood, and the existence of Forms. Use the OCT for the Greek text; good translations of all the dialogues are available in the one volume edition of J. Cooper, Plato, Complete Works (Hackett 1997). Course Director: Dr M Hatzimichali The three-hour paper will contain twelve to fifteen essay questions on the topics covered in lectures, classes and supervisions. Candidates will be required to answer any three questions.The questions will be so formulated as to be answerable without knowledge of Greek, but those with Greek will be rewarded for demonstrating appropriate knowledge of the original text.(Supervisions for this course will be centrally organised for students taking the classical tripos whose directors of studies consent to the arrangement.)In 2017-18 the paper is not available.In 2018-19 the scope and structure of the paper will remain unchanged.ARISTOTLE’S WORLD FROM TURTLES TO TRAGEDIESDR M HATZIMICHALIAmong the most impressive features of Aristotle’s thought is the sheer range of his interests, from hands-on biological research all the way to aesthetics and literary criticism. It has been observed that Aristotle examines tragedy through the same ‘biological’ lens as animals and plants, perhaps to the detriment of his aesthetic thought, while he also speaks of aesthetic appreciation and pleasure to be had from the study of animals. So is there some unity to this monumental intellectual structure, and if so how are we to understand it? We shall approach such questions through selected readings from the Posterior Analytics, and then go on to ask whether Aristotle actually put any of these methodological ideas into practice in his investigations of both animals (where we look at some of his fascinating discoveries in the History of Animals and his more theoretical Parts of Animals and Generation of Animals) and poetry, primarily tragedy (in the Poetics). There will be 16 lectures at the rate of two a week devoted to these themes, plus weekly classes beginning in fifth week, aimed at exploring particular issues or passages in more detail, based on voluntary student participation. Course Director: Mr N C Denyer(This course is intended to be accessible to all Part II students, whether in the Classics or in the Philosophy Faculty, regardless of their knowledge of Greek and Latin, and regardless of what other papers they have taken in Part IB or are taking in Part II.) The examination paper will consist of about twelve essay questions, on topics covered in the course. Candidates will be required to answer three questions.The questions will be so formulated as to be answerable without knowledge of Greek or Latin, but those with Greek or Latin will be rewarded for demonstrating appropriate knowledge of the original text.(Supervisions for this course will be centrally organised for candidates for the classical tripos whose directors of studies consent to the arrangement.)In 2017-18 the paper is not available.In 2018-19 this paper will be replaced by 'Philosophy, Politics and the Polis'. REASON AND REASONINGMR N DENYERGreeks loved reasoning, for advancing practical ends (like doing down a rival in a lawcourt), for achieving theoretical enlightenment (like demonstrating a geometrical theorem beyond all cavil), and sometimes for sheer entertainment (like the agons in tragedy, or contests between rival sophists). Greeks also liked to theorise about reasoning: by no means the strangest example is Plato’s doctrine of the Philosopher Kings, that people are qualified to share in government only if they have extremely well-developed powers of abstract reasoning.In this course we will look at how Greeks reasoned. The topics to be discussed in lectures will fall under four general headings:Science and pseudo-science: debates about the cognitive value of various intellectual enterprises. Sample topic: Ptolemy Tetrabiblos 1.1–3, Sextus Empiricus Adversus Mathematicos 5, for and against astrology.The value of knowledge: can knowledge make us happier, and if so, how? Sample topic: Stoics on how reason can save us from passion, in Section 65 of A.A. Long and D.N. Sedley The Hellenistic Philosophers (Cambridge 1987).Mind and its place in nature: what about the minds of sub- and super-human beings? Sample topic: Epicurus on whether a divine reason controls the world, in Sections 13 and 23 of A.A. Long and D.N. Sedley The Hellenistic Philosophers (Cambridge 1987).Recipes for reasoning: systematic reflections about techniques for argumentation. Sample topic: Aristotle on syllogistic and demonstration in Prior Analytics 1.1–7, Posterior Analytics 1.1–6The classes will give students the opportunity to make presentations on topics of their choice.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

Was it (as some have argued) a question of public affluence matched by private squalor? How can we know? This course will try to provide some answers, through an exploration of three overlapping categories: peoples, times and places. Apart from the traditional 'legal' categories of citizens, metics and slaves (each encompassing both men and women), we will consider the experience of being young and old, rich and poor. 'Times' encompasses 'times of the year' (military service, festivals), 'of the month' (politics), and of the day (work and play). 'Places' include significant areas within the city, both public (Agora, Areopagus, Pnyx, temples, sanctuaries, gymnasia) and private (notably, housing), and in 'Greater Athens' (country demes, the Piraeus). Along the way will be considered a range of supplementary topics, including: literacy, education, health, wealth, poverty, eating and drinking, and crime. The timescale will be approximately the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. Overall, the course will engage with the problems faced by historians in writing the history of society. The process will involve the full range of literary texts (poetry and prose), inscriptions (including graffiti), archaeology, topography, and iconography. Where appropriate will be introduced the comparative testimony of other ancient and not-so-ancient cities and their surroundings.Preliminary reading: R. Osborne (ed.) The World of Athens 2nd edn.

Both the content and the form of the texts that were inscribed provide essential resources for the historian. This course provides an elementary introduction to reading and understanding Greek (weeks 1–4) and Roman (weeks 5–8) inscriptions. Students will be guided in the use of basic epigraphic handbooks and specifically epigraphic scholarly tools, and introduced to the range of types of Greek and Roman inscriptions and to how these change in form and content through time. Examples relevant to the particular interests of students taking the course will be chosen to illustrate the interest and significance of epigraphic material. Those interested should look at J.

These relations become more complex as Rome established domination, first over Italy, and then across the whole Mediterranean world. This imperial expansion brought Rome into increasing contact with other peoples’ gods and cult; just as it brought those same people into increasing contact with Rome’s gods and cult. These encounters were unequal and uneven, within an empire building project, but impact and influences flowed both ways, as the religious landscape of the Roman Empire took shape, and continued to develop over the next centuriesThis course will explore some of the most important of these religious interactions, following a roughly chronological trajectory from the Republican period through to the early decades of the third century AD. The fundamental connections of religion, power and identity at Rome will be examined, Rome’s ‘openness’ to new gods and rituals scrutinised, and issues of the export or imposition of distinctly Roman forms of religious organisation and practice, not to mention the institution of imperial cult, will be explored; as well as the resilience and adaptability of local religious traditions, from Syria to Britain, North Africa to the Rhine frontier. It was not just emperors, and their families, who were worshipped across the Roman domains, part of the pattern of imperial rule, but unofficial, elective cults like those of Isis and Mithras also spread throughout the empire, and religion might play a role in resistance to Roman rule, as it did in the revolts in Judea, as well as in imperial integration.All these themes will be investigated, using a diverse set of textual and material evidence, with questions about the rise of Christianity, as a Roman imperial phenomenon, and about the ways that this development impacted on notions of identity, began to drive a wedge between religious and other facets of cultural identity in the Mediterranean world, also addressed.There will be a mixture of lectures and classes on key themes and topics through the Michaelmas Term. Classes will expand on and develop the topics of the lectures in more detail, looking at the key sources concerned—a range of ancient literary texts, inscriptions, papyri, and archaeological evidence--and the ongoing debates in modern scholarship. A collection of set texts and images will be provided on Moodle, along with reference to a broader assortment of materials; in addition to the general bibliography below, key readings will be listed for each class. In the Easter Term there will be revision classes, focused on gobbets training and other aspects of preparation for the exam.Preliminary reading: J.

The six themes selected relate to the aims, techniques, and content with which classical historians – both Greek and Roman - are concerned. The introductory segment, on ‘Genre(s) of histor(ies)’ reviews the different possible models for history-writing in antiquity, and also serves as an introduction to the key authors being studied in the course; ‘Truth and lies’ looks at techniques of information-gathering, the use of rhetoric to enhance the impact of the text, and historians’ (frequently polemical) engagement with their predecessors; ‘Past and present’ relates the writing of history to configurations of power within which historians were writing; ‘War and peace’ examines the representation of warfare, a fundamental (often defining) theme for ancient writers; ‘Selves and others’ looks at how Greeks and Romans represented those outside the Greco-Roman world, and each other; ‘The ends of history’ explores the aims, moral and commemorative, of history-writing. The course will also engage with the ways, other than through literary historiography, by which a record or narrative of the past was preserved in antiquity; in other words, how individuals and communities shaped and marshalled their past. The course will seek, then, to promote the understanding of these historians within a broader tradition as well as within their immediate intellectual and political context.Each of these themes will be explored in a sequence of three lectures and a class, during which some of the students taking the course will give presentations, and more general discussion of the theme and particular key passages will take place. Herodotus 4 and 5, Thucydides 2, Polybius 6, Livy 1 and Tacitus Annals 4 are prescribed for study, together with a list of shorter passages of particular historiographical interest, taken from a wider range of authors. We would also strongly recommend that in advance of the lectures, students read (in translation) the whole of at least one of the following: Thucydides; Herodotus; Polybius; Sallust Catiline and Jugurtha; Tacitus Annals.Introductory bibliography:C.S.

But what happened next? This paper explores the following two centuries, a period all too frequently characterised as one of doom and disintegration, of decline and fall. Ever since Edward Gibbon, the third to the sixth centuries A.D. have had a raw deal. This paper seeks to change all that. It is an often uncomfortable journey through a world of distant ceremonial emperors, wild ascetic holy men, powerful saints, excitable virgins, charismatic heretics, oppressive bureaucrats and violent barbarians. A world in which long cherished "classical values" were upturned, and in which – or so it has been alleged – an empire declined and fell, barbarians triumphed, and a new religion flourished. This paper concentrates on these upheavals (social, religious, moral, economic, cultural, political) which determined the transformation of the classical Mediterranean into the radically different world of late Antiquity – a world more familiar to its conquerors Mohammed and Charlemagne. Through the exploration of a set of broad topics – for example, the growth of bureaucracy, the development of Byzantine courtly monarchy, the displacement of polytheism by Christianity, the rise of Christian heresies, the emergence of new styles of art and literature, the growing prominence of barbarians, the debates surrounding “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” – this paper aims to reveal something of the unexpected endurance and variety of a society which stands between the more familiar worlds of the Roman Principate and early medieval Europe.In addition to the lectures, there will also be four (2 hr) classes concentrating on ancient historiography.Suggested preliminary reading: P.

How can we reconstruct and ‘read’ the past without the aid of textual records? What are the methods, research questions, principles and current debates in Aegean archaeology? What can we learn from the study of Greece’s rich and varied pre-classical art and archaeological record about the people of Bronze Age Aegean? When, where and why do complex societies ‘emerge’ and ‘collapse’? What is the relationship between the Epics and Classical myths with the archaeology of Bronze and Early Iron Age Greece?This course offers an in-depth survey of the archaeology of the Aegean within the framework of the wider Mediterranean world. Particular emphasis is placed on the societies of the Bronze Age (c. 3200-1100 BC): the worlds of the Early Cyclades, Minoan Crete and Mycenaean Greece. It examines critically the emergence of complex societies and their social, political and economic organisation, the trade and exchange networks, attitudes to death and their burial practices, the archaeologies of ideology, and cult and the integration of textual evidence with the material record.Rich in data, theoretical approaches and problems of interpretation, Aegean Prehistory offers an excellent training ground for explaining the formation, transformation and demise of early bureaucratic societies in the East Mediterranean. It is a journey into our deep human history. Within this framework of investigation, emphasis is also placed on how shifting attitudes to archaeological practice, collection strategies and interpretations have developed over time and have influenced what we know – or think we know – about Greece’s astonishing pre-classical past. Four lectures on the Linear B documents shed light on the economy, bureaucracy and people of Mycenaean Greece. The course ends in the Early Iron Age with an exploration of the art and archaeology at the time of Homer and Hesiod. Despite the focus of the lectures on the Aegean region, the interaction and contacts between this area and the broader Mediterranean world (and their significance) are also explored. As part of the course there is also a tour and handling session at the British Museum.Useful preliminary reading: D. Preziosi & L. Hitchcock, Aegean Art and Architecture (Oxford, 1999); O.

But is this the whole story? What does this leave out of our picture of Greek and Roman artistic production, and the reach of Greek and Roman production, and why? This course starts from the understanding that ‘classical’ (and the qualities of beauty, purity and virtue that come with it) is neither an obvious nor a natural category, and attempts to integrate objects often left on the margins. These include, aniconic, ‘ugly’ and painted images, graffiti from Pompeii, tombstones from Roman Britain and Palmyra, ‘egyptianising' and ‘orientalising’ elements, and, from beyond the ancient Greek and Roman world, mosaics from Byzantium and reliefs from Gandhara. How should we study them? How have they been studied in the past and what does their inclusion do to our appreciation of what Greek and Roman art was, what it looked like, and what it has become? Answering these questions will demand that students test existing vocabularies for talking about material, form and content, and find new vocabularies, building visual knowledge as they do so. The course ends by thinking about the reception of ancient art in the modern period; about how from early in the nineteenth century, this reception increasingly privileged Greek and Roman elements to the exclusion of the Hebraic, Egyptian and Persian; and about how the emergence of the ‘classical’ as an explicit visual category coincided with the celebration of the Hellenic ideal and the down-grading of the Roman. Hopefully, the skills and self-awareness learned on this course will have us better understand what is classical and constraining about ‘classical art’, and also perhaps use current ‘world art’ approaches, issues of art’s agency, and so on, more responsibly. Recommended reading: Boardman, J.

The complex relationship/rivalry between ‘art’ and ‘text’ will be examined by focusing on artistic and archaeological materials, including painted pottery, murals, sculpture, and mosaics from ca. 750 BC to ca. AD 400. We will also look at how the relationship between Classical art and poetry continued to play a major role in the Renaissance and Neoclassical periods. Did visual and written narratives convey different messages to their audience/viewers or were they supposed to complement and reinstate each other? To what extent were the Greek and Roman artists inspired by oral tradition, circulating texts, or contemporary performances? How did the role of the viewer change over time and across the Graeco-Roman world?After providing the essential theoretical background, each lecture focuses on a different historical or cultural issue. The course opens with a discussion of the influence of Homeric poetry in shaping early Greek art. Myth represents a crucial element to follow the development of pictorial narrative in Greece, but the course considers several other modes of interaction between art and poetry, including the relationship between Archaic sculpture and epinician poems, symposium and lyric poetry, theatre and painting, and Hellenistic epigrams and sculpture. In the Roman section, the political, moral and religious propaganda of Augustan art and texts leads us to explore the use of myths in Roman houses in the form of sculptures and paintings. Elegiac and satirical poetry will be used as a tool for exploring themes such as love, luxury and death in Roman imperial art.  Finally, the large and consistent influence of epos on Roman visual culture will round up our discussion, showing that poetry represented a fil rouge in the entire history and development of Classical art. The last lectures will venture beyond the Classical world, in order to explore how Renaissance and Neoclassical artists re-interpreted and contextualized the ‘rivalry’ between Classical art and literature.By considering the artistic evidence within its literary and cultural context, the course analyses how visual and written media interacted with each other and were employed to respond to political, social, economic, and religious priorities. This approach will help us reach a more accurate understanding of the development of Greek and Roman culture and civilization.Preliminary readings: J.

Thousands of towns mediated between Rome and its vast imperial hinterland as they channelled a multidirectional flow of people, goods, cults, ideas and activities. The vast amount of evidence accumulated by archaeologists about Roman urban sites, which has been enhanced in recent years through improved techniques of survey and excavation, has therefore provided a great deal of insight into the functioning of the Roman Empire as such. This course will therefore explore the development of Roman urban culture and the variety of forms it took across space and time, engaging with the diverse interpretations that have since been proposed towards explaining its complex dynamics. By exploring a series of relevant case studies from across the Mediterranean (from Archaic Rome to Augustan Athens, from the earlier Republican colonies of Italy to the Imperial foundations of Northern Africa), these questions will be approached by adopting two broad perspectives: a) we will consider how archaeology can contribute to the understanding of Roman urbanism by looking at different types of urban site (e.g. administrative centres, military strongholds, economic nodes) and their material components (e.g. building techniques, architecture, planning); b) we will review current archaeological and historical debates about the role of cities in the Roman World and look at how these different views can be effectively reconciled into an integrated narrative of empire.Preliminary readings: E.

In the classical period, dialects of a type known as East Greek were spoken in Attica, the Ionian islands and colonies of Asia Minor, in Arcadia in the centre of the Peloponnese, and on Cyprus. The whole of the rest of the Peloponnese, north-western Greece, and Crete spoke dialects of a different type, known as West Greek.In the second millennium BC the picture looks very different. Documents written on clay tablets in a script called Linear B, dating from between 1,400 and 1,200 BC, have been found at Knossos and Chania on Crete, and at Thebes in Boeotia, Mycenae, Tiryns and Midea in the Argolid, and at Pylos in Messenia, i.e. all over the southern Greek world. In 1952, Michael Ventris, an architect and amateur code breaker, aided by John Chadwick, a lecturer in Greek linguistics at Cambridge, demonstrated that the language of these documents was Greek - Greek of a very different sort from that of any classical dialect, but Greek nonetheless. That dialect is now called Mycenaean, although it seems to have been spoken throughout Greece from Boeotia southwards, and it is of a type clearly belonging to the East Greek group.In this course we will look at the early history of the Greek language. We will look at how the various varieties of Greek are related to one another, paying particular attention to Mycenaean and its relation to the dialects of the classical period. We will also consider how and why the dialect map of Greece changed between the second and first millennia.Recommended reading:John Chadwick, The decipherment of Linear B (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967) gives a detailed and fascinating account of the decipherment. His book The Mycenaean World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976) provides a glimpse into the world of the Greek Bronze Age in which the Linear B documents were written. J. T. Hooker, Linear B: An Introduction (Bristol: Bristol Classical Press, 1980) is a good introduction to the language of the Mycenaean documents, and includes many texts in Linear B and Roman transcription, with translation and commentary. The best place to start, however, is the first two chapters of Duhoux and Morpurgo Davies A Companion to Linear B: Mycenaean Texts and their World vol 1 (Louvain-la-Neuve: Peeters, 2008 = BCILL 120).The course comprises the following lecture series: Michaelmas TermMYCENAEAN AND THE GREEK DIALECTSDR R THOMPSON(8 L: weeks 5–8)We will begin by looking at the methods that dialectologists use to classify different varieties and determine how closely they are related. We will then look at the major characteristics of the Greek dialects of the classical period, and use those methods to classify them. There will be an introduction to the Linear B script, its history and the history of its decipherment, and the Mycenaean documents and their world. We will look in detail at the characteristics of Mycenaean Greek, and examine the major issues in determining its relation to the dialects of the classical period. We will ask how the distribution of dialects in the first millennium came about from their somewhat different distribution in the second; and we will ask the question, ‘What happened to Mycenaean at the end of the Bronze Age?’ Lent TermPRESCRIBED TEXTS(DR T MEIßNER and DR P STEELE, 16 L)Edited copies of the prescribed texts will be distributed to the class at the beginning of the course. In these lectures the texts will be discussed in detail, highlighting themes identified in the Michaelmas Term lectures. All texts will be read in Roman transcription. Students may also wish to take note of the following course:THE EPIGRAPHY AND INTERPRETATION OF THE LINEAR B TABLETSDR A JUDSON (8 C: Michaelmas)Instruction in how to read and understand Linear B tablets covering both epigraphy and approaches to interpretation. No previous experience required. The classes are open both to postgraduates and to third-year students taking D and E papers in Part II. Course Director: Dr N A S ZairQuestion 1 will contain passages from the set texts covered in lecture courses for analysis and comment. The remaining questions will cover various topics covered in the course. Candidates are required to answer Question 1 and two other questions.(Supervisions for this course will be centrally organised.)In 2018-2019 the scope and structure of the paper will remain unchanged.LATIN AS SHE IS SPOKEDR N ZAIRDR M ARBABZADAH(8 L: Michaelmas, 8 2hr C: Lent)Like all spoken languages, Latin varied according to place, time, social class of the speaker, genre of text, and many other factors. However, Classical literary texts largely obscure this variation, so that, for example, we do not know what it was about Livy’s language that caused him to be accused of showing features characteristic of his home city of Padua. In this course, we will examine the ways that variation can be identified in Latin, from Republican versus Classical Latin, to the language used by social groups such as Christians and soldiers, and address questions such as whether it is possible to talk about ‘Vulgar Latin’, and whether provinces had their own identifiable dialects of Latin under the Empire. Both inscriptional and manuscript sources will be used to consider how non-literary genres including medical, legal, and technical texts such as cook-books developed their own ‘languages’, in the light of the social and educational backgrounds of authors (where known) and intended readers. We shall use recent theoretical work on language variation and sociolinguistics and examine how far this is applicable to the ancient world, and to what extent it helps ‘fill in the gaps’ in our understanding of the way Latin was used outside the literary elite.Recommended reading: a detailed bibliography arranged by topics for the whole course will be distributed at the beginning of the lecture course and made available on the Faculty website.

They take themes that need to be explored from a number of disciplinary approaches if they are to be understood at all. Characteristically the sequence of lectures and classes both leads you through the millennium of classical culture and through a wide range of ways of thinking about the classical world. Comparison and contrast between similar, or similar-looking, material from different periods is variously combined with both separate and interrelated consideration of distinct aspects of culture. We aim to bring together and capitalise on the wealth of information and expertise that students have acquired from their previous work in Classics and beyond and are acquiring from their concurrent specialist study for the Tripos; at the same time we introduce a range of subjects which they have not encountered before in any directed or systematic way.Each week a lecture is given by an invited specialist. Each lecture is followed by a two-hour class, in which the student group is encouraged to articulate, share, and develop their reactions to the themes of the lecture. Fresh material is also introduced in the classes, both so that points may be amplified, refined and explored and so that the students will gain confidence and solidarity, making the course theirs, over the course of the year, and test out for real whether the ideas and theories work, convince, gel ... Course Directors: Dr I Gildenhard and Dr N J Spivey There will be 16 questions, of which candidates will be required to answer three.

With the onset of modernity, these traditional ways of conceiving the human have been joined and challenged by developments in the natural and social sciences. This course tries to bring into dialogue classical (and classicizing), biblical and scientific perspectives on humanity, to explore their respective outlook and value. Eight lectures, some of which will be given by non-classicists from a range of disciplines will be followed by seminars (and supervisions) on corresponding classical material, not least to test the continuing relevance of Graeco-Roman views in contemporary debates.Topics and sources covered will include: (i) creation myths with a particular emphasis on anthropogenesis; (ii) philosophical anthropology; (iii) the human condition; (iv) normative and universalizing conceptions of humanity; (v) modes of dehumanization both upwards (apotheosis) and downwards (descent to the level of beasts); (vi) the problem of transgression; (vii) the representation of the human body in art; (viii) and notions of the self and personhood. The paper will give attention to both texts and visual material.Preliminary reading: Fuller, S. (2011), Humanity 2.0: What it means to be human, Past, Present, Future; Gildenhard, I. and Zissos, A.

G BETEGHDR H WILLEY(8 L; 8 (2hr) C: Lent)How did the Greeks and Romans think about nature and their place within it? How did they attempt to harness, tame or emulate it? How was nature in turn thought to react to these efforts? In this course we will explore the diverse and complex ways in which the relationship between nature and civilization is negotiated in the literature, art, philosophy and language of Greece and Rome, and the ways in which the natural world shaped the lives and experiences of individuals and communities in the ancient world. Finally, we will consider how the concerns and preoccupations which animate ancient engagements with the natural world relate to and inform our own increasing urgent ecological debates.Topics and sources covered will include: (i) literary and visual depictions of the natural world from pastoral idylls to strange lands; (ii) Greek and Roman gardens, real and imaginary; (iii) medical, philosophical and ethnographic accounts of nature; (iv) the subjugation of nature and its consequences; (v) the relationship between art and nature in literature and visual culture; (vi) sacred landscapes and nature deities; (vii) human impact on the environment and environmental history; (viii) ancient (and modern) concerns about the environment and its degradation. The paper will give attention to both texts and visual material.General reading: R. Futo Kennedy & M. Jones-Lewis (edd.)

If, in your second year, you are considering taking one of the O papers, be sure to attend the special advisory session on them offered in the Faculty at the start of Easter Term. If you do decide to take one, it is important that your Director of Studies should, at the earliest opportunity, put you in touch with an appropriate adviser from the faculty in which the paper is taught. The lecture times for the courses are available from the University’s on-line lecture listings site:http://timetables.caret.cam.ac.uk/live/web/index.html. Details of the syllabus,recommended reading etc. can be obtained from the faculty concerned. If, after following the above routes, you still have problems in obtaining adequate advice, you should consult the Academic Secretary for Undergraduate Affairs.Twelve papers, of which you may take at most one, are available as O Papers. Each gives you an opportunity to learn how another discipline studies a subject adjacent to one that you will have studied within Classics.

It should be made clear that, if the thesis is offered in fulfilment of the Group requirement, the topic does fall wholly within the area of the relevant Group; if it is offered in place of a fourth paper, that it falls within the field of Classics; that it does not coincide substantially with the subject of any of the papers being offered by the candidate. The Board will also wish to be able to see that the topic proposed is comparable in scope and difficulty to what is required for a Part II paper. In the case of candidates taking three papers from the same Group the Faculty Board of Classics will not normally approve a thesis title judged to be too closely related to the papers.(c) The Faculty Board expects candidates and their Directors of Studies to have considered what paper they would offer instead if they decide not to submit a thesis after all (for reason of illness, accident or any other cause). The Board will expect to be told, at the time the application for approval of the thesis title is made, which Paper will be offered if the thesis has to be aborted. It should be understood that if a candidate enters for a thesis and subsequently decides to take a paper instead, this counts as a change of examination entry. This is a College responsibility and it will be necessary for the candidate to take the proper steps to get the examination entry changed; candidates should consult an appropriate College officer. It should be noted that examination entries may NOT be changed after the last day of Lent Full Term.(d) The style of presentation, quotation and reference to books, articles and ancient authorities should be consistent and comply with the standards required by a major journal (such as Classical Quarterly). Candidates will be required to give full references to sources used, and to append a list of the books and articles used in the preparation of the thesis.(e) The Board will expect the thesis to show knowledge of the relevant primary sources. Candidates are expected to select a topic of interest, to focus the issues clearly, handle the material competently and present the argument in an orderly fashion. Additional credit will be given for extensive and detailed knowledge of relevant material, for handling the topic in an enterprising manner and for displaying sound and independent judgement. The thesis is expected to reveal relevant knowledge comparable to that required for a group paper.(f) The limit of 10,000 words should be carefully observed. However, an appendix of relevant material may be submitted and not included in the word limit if this will assist the examiners (if in doubt, candidates should consult the Academic Secretary for Undergraduate Affairs). Material presented under the heading ‘Illustrations’ at the end of an undergraduate dissertation (after bibliography) is excluded from the aforementioned word limit. This ‘supporting material’ can include figures, maps, charts, diagrams, plans and data in tables, all of these with captions (which may be attached to each individual ‘illustration’ or presented as a list), but excludes catalogues. Captions should be as brief as possible and should not be used as a substitute for information which should properly be placed in the main text.(g) Supervision should be on the same scale as for a group paper. Supervisors may discuss the scope and extent of the topic and provide bibliographical and similar advice and information. Supervisors may comment freely on the first and second drafts of the outline and of any one section or chapter but, for the rest, should confine their comments to the first draft of the thesis.(h) Candidates are required to submit two hard copies and two electronic copies of the thesis.(i) The Faculty will be employing Turnitin software to detect plagiarism in Part II theses. You are obliged to have read and understood the University’s policy on plagiarism which is given at http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/plagiarism/students/statement.html.(j) All those offering a thesis will be called to a viva. The main purpose of the viva is to verify that the thesis is a student’s own work, though the examiners will also give an opportunity to discuss and elaborate a student’s ideas. 'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

This first year has two main aims: (i) to give you a secure grounding in the Latin language so that you can understand and enjoy original Latin texts; (ii) to start you thinking about other areas of the ancient world and the tools and skills that a Classicist needs to investigate them. The core of the language teaching is a programme of reading and grammar classes taken by our language specialists. As new first years studying the Four Year Degree, you will have attended a Latin Summer School. This is language-based and designed to introduce you to the basic structure of the Latin language and to begin or enhance your experience of it. The term-time course takes you on from there. One of our most important aims over the course of this year is to start you on the road to becoming a confident reader of original Latin, so that you can read the works of Roman authors with accuracy and pleasure. A substantial part of the first year course is built around the reading of a group of Latin texts, and you will begin with your first author around the middle of the first term. The language classes you attend are designed to teach and support your language learning in a variety of ways. On one level, they will be teaching you the grammar and syntax basic to the functioning of the Latin language; on another level, introducing you to the support materials and tools which students need to develop their understanding of Latin (for instance, dictionaries, commentaries, IT learning resources and others), and at a third level, they will be helping you to read the texts in a structured way.Learning to read an ancient language is a complex and challenging business and is at the core of much of what we do as Classicists. There is a huge difference between reading the works of Roman (and later, Greek) authors in translation and reading them in the original language, where the pattern and structure of the language itself provide a vital insight into the thought processes and cultural assumptions of the writers and society which produced them. This centrality to the task of the Classicist – which is to find out as much about the Ancient World as possible and to interrogate and respond to what has been discovered – is why language learning is at the heart of the first part of our degree, whether you are approaching it as a Four-Year or as a Three-Year candidate. Four-Year Degree students take Latin first to enable them to concentrate on one language and culture before taking on the next. Four Year Degree students have their own programme of lectures. These introduce candidates to the breadth and variety of what we study in the Classics Faculty in Cambridge: literature, history, art and archaeology and philology and linguistics. They will focus on a central period of Roman history, but with a consciousness of a Greek background where appropriate. A central element of the teaching and learning experience of Cambridge is the dovetailing of Faculty teaching with College provision: and this is no different for the Four Year Degree. You will have supervisions organised by your Director of Studies in your College. Some of these supervisions will be designed to support and extend the work you are doing in your Faculty language classes. Others will be essay supervisions. Using material gained from lectures and from guided reading you will be working to write essays about different aspects of Roman culture, piecing together evidence and developing arguments about the material and ways to think about it.The dovetailing between Faculty and College teaching may – and should – take on a number of different forms during the first year of the Four Year Degree, and indeed, during your time in Cambridge. Sometimes the connection between them will seem almost seamless: at other times, there may be a noticeable difference of approach. For instance, a supervisor may see a particular problem very differently from the way a lecturer has presented it and want to offer a very different argument for the way to apply the evidence. This has a number of benefits: it means that you get to have different points of view put before you and discussed; it can mean that you feel more confident about expressing your view – if there is no strict 'orthodoxy' then why shouldn't your views on a question be just as valid as other people’s?; it can mean that the teaching and learning, in both content and style, can be tailored to individual needs. Your College Director of Studies is there to keep an overall view of what teaching you are receiving and to be ready to deal with problems if they arise. Four Year Degree candidates also have the Four Year Degree Course Co-Ordinator (Dr R S Omitowoju) in the Faculty to ask for advice.The teaching for the Four Year Degree falls broadly into five kinds: Four-Year Degree candidates sit the Preliminary Examination during their first year. This exam consists of three papers. Papers 1 and 2 are in the form of traditional examination papers and take place in the first week of Easter Full Term. Paper 3 consists of a portfolio of the two essays done in Easter term. It is to be submitted by the seventh Tuesday of the Full Easter Term in which the examination takes place (5 June 2018).Papers 1 and 2 are language exams and are intended to reflect and test the level of reading reached by this time in the course. Like all language papers in the Classics Faculty, these papers are marked positively: i.e. you will gain credit for what you do well, rather than just losing marks for what you do less well. The different passages will aim to test a variety of skills, so that everyone has the best chance to show what they can do. Paper 1 will focus primarily on translation and appreciation of passages from the Target Texts. Paper 2 will contain two unseens, a passage from the Target Texts for linguistic comment and English sentences for translation into Latin. Passages for unseen translation may come from other works by the same authors as the Target Texts, or they may be from others: however, passages will be chosen to avoid, as far as possible, an accumulation of rare vocabulary or idiosyncratic syntax. Part of the first year work is examined by means of a portfolio of essays which is submitted in the second half of Easter term. The portfolio contains two essays on subjects relating to the two target texts which will be studied in the Easter term: a selection of Catullus’ poems and Caesar’s De Bello Gallico. One of the essays is to be broadly literary in approach; the other may approach the target text from the standpoint of any of the sub-disciplines within Classics.The titles are to be decided upon by the student in consultation with his or her supervisor. The titles are then to be countersigned by the student's Director of Studies and the Four Year Degree Co-Ordinator. The Academic Secretary for Undergraduate Affairs will circulate forms to students at the beginning of Easter term. It is the student's responsibility to submit the completed form, countersigned by their Director of Studies and the Four Year Degree Co-Ordinator, to the Academic Secretary for Undergraduate Affairs of the Faculty by the fourth Monday of Full Easter Term (21 May 2018).There is a word limit of 4,000 words for each essay, including notes, but excluding bibliography. For these essays, students should receive two hours of supervision on each of the essays. In the first supervision, detailed feedback, constructive criticism and advice about both content and structure will be offered by the supervisor. The second supervision enables the supervisor to see and comment on the work that the student has done in response to the suggestions made in the first supervision. The supervisor should not normally see the essay again.The portfolio is conceived as a way in which students may demonstrate the development of their skills in essay work over the year, and as such should not be thought of as a wholly different form of exercise. Rather, it is aiming to be a ‘normal’ essay, but with the benefit of one additional opportunity to respond to detailed comments and one additional opportunity to ‘polish’ the essay. Qualities which will be looked for will be: a good knowledge of the texts and an ability to comment on their language and style where appropriate; knowledge of the most relevant secondary material and the capacity to offer some level of close reading and criticism of this material; the ability to construct a coherent argument.The portfolio is to be submitted by the student to the Academic Secretary for Undergraduate Affairs of the Faculty by the seventh Tuesday of the Full Easter Term (5 June 2018). Students are required to sign a declaration that the essays in their portfolio are their own work, and do not contain material already used to any substantial extent for a comparable purpose. All essays must be word processed (1.5 spacing) unless permission has been obtained from the Faculty Board to present them in handwritten form. The style of presentation, quotation and reference to books, articles and ancient authorities should be consistent and comply with the standards required by a major journal (such as Classical Quarterly). Two copies of each essay should be submitted: if bound, each copy must be bound separately. Easter term week 0: after exam papers 1 and 2, students receive their copy of the portfolio form from the Academic Secretary for Undergraduate Affairs.Easter term weeks 1 and 2: students have initial discussions with their supervisors about titles for the two essays. They may also seek advice from their DoS and the Four Year Degree Co-Ordinator. By the fourth Monday of Full Easter Term (21 May 2018) the completed form with the titles, signed by the student and countersigned by the student's Director of Studies and the Four Year Degree Co-Ordinator, is submitted to the Academic Secretary for Undergraduate Affairs of the Faculty. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that this is done by the relevant date.During the subsequent weeks the two essays are completed, including both the initial supervisions and the additional half-hour supervision for each essay. By the seventh Tuesday of the Full Easter Term in which the examination takes place (5 June 2018) the two essays are submitted to the Academic Secretary for Undergraduate Affairs of the Faculty.'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:

Susanna Braund Latin Literature (2002) and Oliver Taplin (ed.) Latin Literature in the Roman World (2000) make a lively introduction. CICERO, IN CATILINAM IPROF. M BEARD(4 L: Michaelmas, weeks 5–8)These lectures will reflect on the importance of, and background to, the Catilinarian conspiracy – both as an historical event and an oratorical/textual moment. Can we get to the “truth” behind Cicero’s speeches? Why did they become the most famous Roman speeches ever? Why is “Quousque tandem …” still used as a political slogan? OVID, METAMORPHOSES 4DR I GILDENHARD(4 L: Lent, weeks 5–8)An introduction to the most ambitious of Ovid's works – the enchanting, violent and often hilarious world of the Metamorphoses. The lectures will read book IV in detail, untangling a complex web of stories, from the the tragicomedy of Pyramus and Thisbe to the gender fusion of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus to the legendary heroism of Perseus. Read the text with Dr Omitowoju’s commentary and read the whole poem in translation beforehand. CAESAR, BELLUM GALLICUM 4 AND 5DR I GILDENHARDPROF. C KELLY(4 L: Easter, weeks 1–2)Julius Caesar, perhaps the most influential man in the history of Rome and its empire, had interests that stretched beyond the battlefield. He was a celebrated writer of Latin prose narrative who sought not only to portray his own military exploits in a favourable light but also to achieve an elegant and engaging literary style. His seven-book Gallic Wars covers seven years of his military campaigns in Western Europe in the 50s B.C. These two sections of Books 4 and 5 from that work describe Caesar's two remarkable assaults on Britain in 55 and 54 B.C.: did he bite off more than he could chew? Questions of broader significance will be considered: why did Caesar write such a work, and why in the third-person? Can he be treated as a trustworthy source? Is there more to these accounts than meets the eye? Use the text in D.A. John, Caesar’s Expedition to Britain (Bristol Classical Press, 1991). CATULLUS, A SELECTIONDR D JOLOWICZ(4 L: Easter, weeks 1-2))In these lectures we shall explore the life and poetry of C. Valerius Catullus, the poet who lived in the turbulent years preceding the fall of the Roman Republic, and who was so influential on subsequent poetry. Perhaps best known for his expressions of love and hate for Lesbia, his poems are populated by a cast of characters through whom we learn what it means to be included in (or excluded from) Rome’s smart set. The lectures will focus on Catullus’ relationship with men and women and his attitudes towards poetry and politics. Prescribed poems are 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 29, 32, 35, 48, 50, 51, 58, 70, 72, 75, 83, 85, 87, 100, 101, to be read with Godwin, J., ed. (1999), Catullus: The Shorter Poems. Warminster. ROMAN PHILOSOPHYDR M HATZIMICHALI(2 L: Michaelmas, weeks 3-4)An introduction to philosophical writing at Rome, with a particular focus on Lucretius, Cicero and Seneca. INTRODUCTION TO ROMAN HISTORYDR R FLEMMING(4 L: Michaelmas, weeks 1–4)This course provides an outline of Rome’s political, social and cultural development from the foundation of the city into the early imperial period. The formation, working, and then unravelling of the Republican system, of the Roman Republican state and society, will be the focus of these classes, to provide some historical context for the texts to be studied, but these changes will also be placed within a wider timeframe, a wider set of circumstances and contingencies.Introductory reading: M. Beard & M.H. Crawford, Rome in the Late Republic (2nd edn, London, 1999); D. M. Gwynn, The Roman Republic: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2012). INTRODUCTION TO ROMAN HISTORYDR H WILLEY(4 L: Lent, weeks 1–4)A key factor in Rome’s transition from Republic to Principate was her ever-expanding empire. Complementing Dr Flemming’s Michaelmas lectures, in this course that empire takes centre stage. What factors (political, cultural, social and military) drove Roman imperialism? How and why did it work? What changed from Republic to Principate in the discourse and practicalities of empire? In addition to exploring these questions, this course will also provide an introduction to some of the historical issues that arise from the Catullus and Caesar texts to be read in Easter Term.Introductory reading: G. Woolf, Rome: an empire’s story (2012); A. Lintott, Imperium Romanum: politics and administration (1993). INTRODUCTION TO ROMAN MATERIAL CULTUREDR J JIMENEZ(4 L: Michaelmas, weeks 5–8)These four sessions will introduce you to the study of material evidence for the Roman world. Through an examination of various types of artefact, from buildings to everyday objects, we will explore the contributions of archaeology to understanding the classical past.Suggested introductory reading: K. Greene, Archaeology: An Introduction (2002). INTRODUCTION TO LATIN PHILOLOGYDR P STEELE(4 L: Lent, weeks 5–8)A brief introduction to the formal and systematic study of language. We will look at the origin and history of the Latin language and the Latin alphabet, as well as thinking about some ways in which the modern discipline of linguistics can be applied to the study of Latin. This will include a consideration of some literary and non-literary texts, and you may find the lectures helpful to your language-learning, and historically interesting, even if you are not intending to take the study of linguistics further. Previous experience of linguistics is NOT expected.Suggested introductory reading: J. Clackson and G. Horrocks, Blackwell History of the Latin Language (Blackwell, 2007).'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey' in 'Building the Ancient City: Athens and Rome', BBC Two'Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill takes us on a journey across stunning locations in Greece and Italy to find out how Athens gave birth to the idea of a city run by free citizens 2,500 years ago.'Applications invited for Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Scheme 2018 We are keen to support high quality applications that intersect with research already being undertaken or developed in the Classics Faculty.Archaeologists uncover rare 2,000-year-old sundial during Roman theatre excavationA 2,000-year-old intact and inscribed sundial has been recovered by students of the Faculty of Classics...'Mary Beard brings her passion for classics to Front Row' BBC TwoBBC Two's 'Front Row', hosted by Mary Beard:
