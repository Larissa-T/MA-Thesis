This could be a research project, an internship, engagement with language teaching or learning, development of language teaching or learning materials, shadowing of a professional in the applicant’s intended career path, or some other applied linguistics project. We anticipate that the scholarship amount will be $2500-$4000.All majors and class standing may apply if you meet all of the following:Your application should include:Submit your application by email with the subject line "Sawyer Scholarship 2017" to Martine Alexander (martinea@berkeley.edu) by March 1, 2017. Applicants will be notified by March 25th.If you have questions, please contact the Undergraduate Staff Advisor, Martine Alexander, at martinea@berkeley.edu .BLS CogNetwork*dhworomFieldwork Forum Language and Cognition LabPhonetics and Phonology ForumPhonLabScript Encoding InitiativeSurvey of California and Other Indian LanguagesSyntax & Semantics CircleDepartment AddressUniversity of California, BerkeleyDepartment of Linguistics1203 Dwinelle Hall #2650Berkeley, CA 94720-2650Department Emaillinginfo@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail)PhoneGeneral Information: (510) 642-2757Undergraduate Information: (510) 642-2757Graduate Information: (510) 643-7224Visiting Scholars: (510) 643-7224Fax: (510) 643-5688Copyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe Society of Linguistics Undergraduate Students is a student-run organization that hosts weekly academic and social activities for lovers of linguistics. Past events include a talk from David J. Peterson, creator of Dothraki from Game of Thrones, a monolingual elicitation, palatography, tours of the PhonLab, and sponsorship of a regional Esperanto conference. We try our best to provide a space for linguistics students outside the classroom setting, both to create connections and foster discussion about linguistics itself and about the degree and its applicability.

Linguistics 154: Language Revitalization: Theory and PracticeThis course explores a range of theories and practices that undergird efforts by linguists and language activists to revitalize and revalorize endangered languages in communities around the world, with a focus on the Americas. Beginning with an exploration of how linguistic diversity, language vitality, and language politics interact, the course will narrow focus toward individual student projects that explore language revitalization issues in the context of a specific language or community, including the option to create usable revitalization materials for that community.It is simultaneously true that individual languages become endangered for reasons that are rooted in their specific social, historical, and political contexts; and that large-scale patterns and causes of language endangerment can be identified and therefore redressed. If, in a given language community, language revitalization is a desired objective, then a clear understanding of the specific factors that led to endangerment can make the difference between success and failure in revitalization work.This course takes a holistic view of the question of language vitality, approaching it as both a linguistic and a social phenomenon. Therefore, we will draw on a range of relevant perspectives -- from linguistics and language documentation to linguistic, social, and activist anthropology. Similarly, we will examine language endangerment and revitalization as experienced in non-westernized contexts along with westernized ones.  BLS CogNetwork*dhworomFieldwork Forum Language and Cognition LabPhonetics and Phonology ForumPhonLabScript Encoding InitiativeSurvey of California and Other Indian LanguagesSyntax & Semantics CircleDepartment AddressUniversity of California, BerkeleyDepartment of Linguistics1203 Dwinelle Hall #2650Berkeley, CA 94720-2650Department Emaillinginfo@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail)PhoneGeneral Information: (510) 642-2757Undergraduate Information: (510) 642-2757Graduate Information: (510) 643-7224Visiting Scholars: (510) 643-7224Fax: (510) 643-5688Copyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyFrom 1901-02 through 1905-06, according to University of California publications, courses under the heading Linguistics were taught at UC. They are listed below, together with the general linguistics course offerings in Anthropology (which began in 1903-04). After the 1905-06 academic year, general linguistics courses were taught in Anthropology until the late 1910s. (Note that the modern convention whereby numbers below 100 designate lower-division courses was not yet in effect; some of these courses were for graduate students and none were for lower-division students.)BLS CogNetwork*dhworomFieldwork Forum Language and Cognition LabPhonetics and Phonology ForumPhonLabScript Encoding InitiativeSurvey of California and Other Indian LanguagesSyntax & Semantics CircleDepartment AddressUniversity of California, BerkeleyDepartment of Linguistics1203 Dwinelle Hall #2650Berkeley, CA 94720-2650Department Emaillinginfo@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail)PhoneGeneral Information: (510) 642-2757Undergraduate Information: (510) 642-2757Graduate Information: (510) 643-7224Visiting Scholars: (510) 643-7224Fax: (510) 643-5688Copyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyBLS CogNetwork*dhworomFieldwork Forum Language and Cognition LabPhonetics and Phonology ForumPhonLabScript Encoding InitiativeSurvey of California and Other Indian LanguagesSyntax & Semantics CircleDepartment AddressUniversity of California, BerkeleyDepartment of Linguistics1203 Dwinelle Hall #2650Berkeley, CA 94720-2650Department Emaillinginfo@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail)PhoneGeneral Information: (510) 642-2757Undergraduate Information: (510) 642-2757Graduate Information: (510) 643-7224Visiting Scholars: (510) 643-7224Fax: (510) 643-5688Copyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyUC Berkeley, in general, will not grant a second degree to someone holding an advanced degree in the same field. But, students who already hold an M.A. degree from another institution in Linguistics, or any field, and are admitted into the Linguistics Ph.D. program at Berkeley, will be granted a second M.A. upon completion of the M.A. requirements. Students who are enrolled in a Ph.D. program in Linguistics elsewhere at the time they apply to U.C. Berkeley will not be allowed to transfer Ph.D. units. If the Department of Linguistics or the Graduate Division determines from information provided on the application that a student will obtain a Linguistics-related Ph.D. degree before the date that he/she would enter our graduate program, the application will not be processed. Though the University wishes to discourage students who already hold a Ph.D. in an unrelated subject from enrolling in the Ph.D. program in Linguistics, we can petition for an exception to this policy.Students enrolled at any University of California campus may take courses at another UC campus for credit to be applied to their home department's degree program. Students interested in this option should talk to their own department, as well as to the faculty members in our department who would be teaching the courses that are of interest to them. An application form for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be obtained from Graduate Services, 318 Sproul Hall, (510) 642-7330. Students who have maintained good standing at UC Berkeley or at Stanford University for a year of graduate study may apply to take courses through the Stanford-California Exchange Program. Doctoral students who have completed one year of studies at Berkeley are also eligible to participate in the Exchange Scholar Program which allows them to study at Brown, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Stanford or Yale for up to one year. More information on this program can also be obtained through Graduate Division. Graduate students who have completed at least one year at UC Berkeley may be granted permission to study abroad at most of the study centers under the Education Abroad Program. (Linguistics students are encouraged to apply for Foreign Language Area Study (FLAS) fellowships for the summer or the regular academic year in order to secure funding for foreign language study at home or abroad.) For more information on the Education Abroad Program write to: Berkeley Programs for Study Abroad, 160 Stephens Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720-2302, (510) 642-1356 or (510) 642-1790.Students whose primary interest is in the field of Applied Linguistics, especially the Teaching of English as a Second Language (TESOL or ESL) should be aware that there is no faculty specialization in this area at UC Berkeley and very little relevant coursework offered in the Department of Linguistics. (Note, however, there are some courses offered through the Education Department's Language and Literacy Program.) Linguistic programs with specialization in TESOL and other areas of Applied Linguistics are San Jose State University (San Jose, CA 94192), the University of California, Los Angeles (Los Angeles, CA 90024), San Francisco State University (San Francisco, CA 94132), the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI 48109), Ohio University (Athens, OH 45701-2979), Georgetown University (Washington, D.C. 20057), and Southern Illinois University (Carbondale, IL 62901).Students whose primary interest is in the field of language translation should consider the programs at Georgetown University (Washington, D.C. 20057) and at the Monterey Institute of Foreign Studies (Monterey, CA 93940). If you wish to obtain information on other programs in Linguistics in the United States and Canada you can access the Linguistic Society of America's (LSA) web site. Questions regarding the LSA Directory of Programs in Linguistics may be addressed to LSA Secretariat, lsa@lsadc.org.Students should choose whether or not to apply to UC Berkeley Linguistics carefully, making sure that their interests overlap to a significant degree with the expectations of the program. Having fulfilled the requirements for the M.A. in Linguistics students have more flexibility in choice of classes, since there are few additional course requirements beyond the M.A. program in our department. To have recognition for breadth of interests, it is possible to take a second M.A. in another department before proceeding to a Ph.D. Another option would be to design a unique course of study. Such an option is only available to students with a superior academic record who have completed at least two semesters of a doctoral program at UC Berkeley, working with faculty members from several departments to create an individual program, which then must meet with the approval of the Dean of the Graduate Division. It is not possible to be admitted to UC Berkeley as an "unaffiliated student". Students must first be admitted into and show success in a particular program before designing a unique course of study. It is possible, however, for a person who has not been accepted into a graduate program to take individual courses of interest. (See the section on Concurrent Enrollment.)Students who have completed coursework relevant to our program at another institution may be allowed to apply that work toward a degree at UC Berkeley. This can be accomplished in one of two ways: either by formal transfer of credit or by waiver of requirements. After the first semester of residence at UC Berkeley a graduate student may transfer up to 4 semester units or 6 quarter units toward the M.A. program in the Department of Linguistics. This lowers the number of units necessary to complete the degree, but it does not automatically fulfill any other departmental requirements. Alternatively, work can be applied toward an M.A. at UC Berkeley through a waiver of requirements. In certain cases a required course may be waived if a student has previously completed coursework that is comparable to the corresponding course at Berkeley. Such a waiver requires the permission of the professor who normally teaches the course, as well as that of the Head Graduate Advisor. Unlike a transfer of units, this waiver will not decrease the total units of UC Berkeley coursework required for the M.A. degree. It may, however, allow the student to take more advanced courses and enable the student to receive the degree sooner.Even if you are not enrolled in an academic department at UC Berkeley, it is possible to take many of the Linguistics courses that are offered to Berkeley students through Concurrent Enrollment, a program that is under the auspices of UC Extension. Taking Linguistics courses through this program does not imply that you have been or will be accepted into the Department of Linguistics' graduate program. If you are later accepted into the program you would not be able to transfer courses you have taken under Concurrent Enrollment towards the course load required for an M.A. degree, though it would allow you to skip certain prerequisite courses in order to take more specialized courses during the M.A. program. One advantage of taking courses through Concurrent Enrollment is that you might become more familiar with the faculty members and have a better idea of the focus of our program. For further information, contact the UC Extension Office, 1995 University Avenue, Suite #110, Berkeley, CA 94720-7000; (510) 642-4111.No courses required for the Linguistics M.A. are offered in the summer, only introductory undergrad linguistics courses can be taken. To obtain more information and to register for classes contact the Summer Sessions Office, 1995 University Avenue, Suite #1080, Berkeley, CA 94720-1080, (510) 642-5611. All students are encouraged to participate in one or more of the Linguistic Institutes sponsored every other summer by the Linguistic Society of America (LSA). Each Linguistic Institute features a wide range of courses, seminars, conferences, workshops, and lectures covering developments in Linguistics and related fields; Berkeley graduate students and faculty often participate. Scholarships are available from the LSA and possibly (depending on funding) from the Berkeley Department of Linguistics.

Note: applicants are responsible for reading and complying with all application guidelines. Below are further details about a few important aspects of the admissions application.Admissions Essays: Your statement of purpose should: 1. Include the names of the faculty members whose research seems to match your own interests, and briefly discuss the connections you see. Please also provide this information where requested on the on-line application. 2. Describe your relevant research experience, and note any publications you have authored or co-authored. Here is some helpful advice about writing the statement of purpose and the personal statement.Letters of Recommendation: Three letters of recommendation are required. You will be asked to submit the names of your recommenders and valid email addresses as part of the on-line application. The admissions system will contact them directly, and you will be able to check whether their letters have been added to the application. Please give your recommenders plenty of advanced notification for submitting their letters so that they may be submitted by the deadline.Transcripts: Copies of all relevant official transcripts from all university/college level institutions attended (this requirement applies to both domestic and international applicants) must be submitted/uploaded with your on-line Graduate Application for Admissions and Fellowships. Transcripts in a language other than English must be accompanied by official English translations, as described in the "International Applicants" section of the Graduate Division's Admissions Requirements. Note: Submission of official/sealed transcripts will only be required if you are admitted to the program and you accept the offer of admission.English Proficiency: All applicants from countries in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. See the admissions requirements web page for details.Writing Sample: A writing sample is required of all applicants. Ideally, this sample would be a research paper on a linguistic topic, but it should in any event demonstrate the applicant's competence in writing analytic expository prose. The writing sample is to be submitted/uploaded with your on-line application.BLS CogNetwork*dhworomFieldwork Forum Language and Cognition LabPhonetics and Phonology ForumPhonLabScript Encoding InitiativeSurvey of California and Other Indian LanguagesSyntax & Semantics CircleDepartment AddressUniversity of California, BerkeleyDepartment of Linguistics1203 Dwinelle Hall #2650Berkeley, CA 94720-2650Department Emaillinginfo@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail)PhoneGeneral Information: (510) 642-2757Undergraduate Information: (510) 642-2757Graduate Information: (510) 643-7224Visiting Scholars: (510) 643-7224Fax: (510) 643-5688Copyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe Department strives to provide funding for every graduate student. Particular effort in recent years has gone to putting together multi-year (usually 5-year) funding packages for newly admitted students, although this is not always possible. Funding can take a variety of forms, both internal and extramural, including:The ideal funding package is a 5-year combination of fellowship support and teaching, which many students augment with 6th year dissertation fellowships; this combination provides students both with the opportunity to do fulltime coursework and research and with the opportunity to gain teaching experience. The experience of teaching is invaluable in a student's own training in linguistics; it is also essential in the post-Ph.D. competition for academic positions, a competition in which Berkeley Ph.D.s typically excel, due to the depth and breadth of their graduate training.The Graduate Division fellowships website has a helpful and comprehensive list of fellowships and other funding opportunities available to new and continuing graduate students. Information in a much briefer form is provided in the Graduate Division's flyer on graduate study.

There is no application required for study in the Linguistics department. Application packets can be obtained in October from most California high school or community college counselors' offices, from any UC campus, or by contacting the Office of Undergraduate Admission and Relations, 110 Sproul Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720-5800, (510/642-3175). The application also is available on-line. Go to the University of California admissions site.All transfer students must meet UC eligibility requirements and the College of Letters and Science "Essential Skills" requirements for admission. Information is available at http://students.berkeley.edu/admissions/transfer.asp.To declare the Linguistics major, it is necessary first to complete Linguistics 100 with a grade of "C" or better and then submit the "Major Declaration Petition"  to the Undergraduate Student Advisor in 1205 Dwinelle Hall.

Linguists with BA's are frequently hired to teach foreign languages, English as a second or foreign language, and literacy. Employment opportunities also are available in such fields as health services, speech technology, legal consulting, writing and editing, language teaching, data mining, lexicography, and translation. Specialization outside the major (in language teaching, communication services, journalism, computational methods, psycholinguistics) is likely to enhance employability in these areas. Those wishing to continue to graduate school with a Linguistics BA from Berkeley will find themselves competitive for PhD programs in Linguistics and, depending on the focus of their major, in Anthropology, Psychology, Education, Sociology, and other fields. Berkeley BA recipients often continue to graduate school for professional degrees, as well, in areas such as speech language pathology, information management, library and information studies, accounting, museum studies, neuroscience, and law. Linguistics majors do well in the job market and in graduate school because of their skills in writing, critical thinking and interpersonal relations that are highly valued by employers and that apply to a wide variety of professional jobs.Some representative job titles of recent Linguistics major graduates:BLS CogNetwork*dhworomFieldwork Forum Language and Cognition LabPhonetics and Phonology ForumPhonLabScript Encoding InitiativeSurvey of California and Other Indian LanguagesSyntax & Semantics CircleDepartment AddressUniversity of California, BerkeleyDepartment of Linguistics1203 Dwinelle Hall #2650Berkeley, CA 94720-2650Department Emaillinginfo@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail)PhoneGeneral Information: (510) 642-2757Undergraduate Information: (510) 642-2757Graduate Information: (510) 643-7224Visiting Scholars: (510) 643-7224Fax: (510) 643-5688Copyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyCourses Pre-approved as Electives for the Linguistics Major and Minor:AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES 242  Special Topics in African Linguistics (Needs faculty approval each semester.)ANTHROPOLOGY 166 Language, Culture and Society  ANTHROPOLOGY 169C Research Theory and Methods in Linguistic AnthropologyCELTIC STUDIES 102A Elementary BretonCELTIC STUDIES 105A Old and Middle IrishCELTIC STUDIES 161 Celtic LinguisticsCHINESE 161 Structure of Chinese LanguageCHINESE 165 History of the Chinese LanguageCHINESE 167 Chinese DialectologyJAPANESE 120 Introduction to Classical JapaneseJAPANESE 160 Introduction to Japanese Linguistics: GrammarJAPANESE 161 Introduction to Japanese Linguistics: UsageJAPANESE 162 History of the Japanese LanguageKOREAN 160 Korean LinguisticsDUTCH 107 The Structure of Modern DutchAFRIKAANS 150 Languages and Cultures of South AfricaENGLISH 101 The History of the English Language (Needs faculty approval each semester.)ENGLISH 102 Topics in the English Language (Needs faculty approval each semester.)ENGLISH 179 Literature and LinguisticsFRENCH 145 History of the French LanguageFRENCH 146A/B Introduction to French LinguisticsFRENCH 147 Special Topics in French LinguisticsFRENCH 173 Linguistics and LiteratureGERMAN 103 Introduction to German LinguisticsGERMAN 105 Middle High German for UndergraduatesGERMAN C109/L&S180T Language and PowerGERMAN 170 History of the German LanguageGERMAN 173 The Phonetics and Phonology of Modern GermanGERMAN 174 The Morphology and Syntax of Modern GermanINFORMATION 159 Natural Language ProcessingCUNEIFORM 100A/B Elementary AkkadianCUNEIFORM 101A/B Intermediate AkkadianCUNEIFORM 102A/B Elementary SumerianCUNEIFORM 103A/B Intermediate SumerianCUNEIFORM 106A/B Elementary HittiteEGYPTIAN 100A/B Elementary EgyptianEGYPTIAN 101A/B Intermediate EgyptianHEBREW 105A The Structure of Modern HebrewHEBREW 106A Elementary Biblical HebrewSEMITICS 100B AramaicPHILOSOPHY 133 Philosophy of LanguagePHILOSOPHY 134 Form & MeaningPHILOSOPHY 135 Theory of MeaningPSYCHOLOGY C124 PsycholinguisticsPSYCHOLOGY 143 Language AcquisitionSCANDINAVIAN 100A or 100B Intermediate Scandinavian Languages (Danish, Norwegian, Swedish)                      SCANDINAVIAN 101A Introduction to Old Norse                                                                                                              SCANDINAVIAN 180 Socio-Historical Scandinavian Linguistics                                                                                      SCANDINAVIAN 201A Old NorseSLAVIC LANGUAGES C137 Introduction to Slavic LinguisticsSANSKRIT 100A/B Elementary SanskritSPANISH 100 Introduction to Spanish LinguisticsSPANISH 161 Spanish Phonetics and PhonologySPANISH 162 The Structure of SpanishSPANISH 164 Spanish DialectologySPANISH 165AC Coexistence and Conflict: Amerindian, English, and Spanish in the SouthwestSPANISH 166 Language and StyleSPANISH 179 Advanced Course in Hispanic LinguisticsUGIS  120 Introduction to Applied Language StudiesBLS CogNetwork*dhworomFieldwork Forum Language and Cognition LabPhonetics and Phonology ForumPhonLabScript Encoding InitiativeSurvey of California and Other Indian LanguagesSyntax & Semantics CircleDepartment AddressUniversity of California, BerkeleyDepartment of Linguistics1203 Dwinelle Hall #2650Berkeley, CA 94720-2650Department Emaillinginfo@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail)PhoneGeneral Information: (510) 642-2757Undergraduate Information: (510) 642-2757Graduate Information: (510) 643-7224Visiting Scholars: (510) 643-7224Fax: (510) 643-5688Copyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe department's honors program affords students the opportunity to learn how to put together a major research paper. It is necessary to have a minimum grade point average of 3.5, both overall and in the upper-division requirements for the major, to apply for admission to the honors program. The program consists of enrolling in 2-4 units in the Linguistics Honors (H195) course for 2 continuous semesters, normally in the student's final year. Under the direction of a faculty member, students carry out research and submit a thesis critically summarizing the material that has been covered. The deadline for submitting theses is the Monday of the 13th week of classes of the semester in which the thesis is submitted. Students who finish in the Spring semester will have an opportunity to present their research at a department colloquium at the end of the semester.BLS CogNetwork*dhworomFieldwork Forum Language and Cognition LabPhonetics and Phonology ForumPhonLabScript Encoding InitiativeSurvey of California and Other Indian LanguagesSyntax & Semantics CircleDepartment AddressUniversity of California, BerkeleyDepartment of Linguistics1203 Dwinelle Hall #2650Berkeley, CA 94720-2650Department Emaillinginfo@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail)PhoneGeneral Information: (510) 642-2757Undergraduate Information: (510) 642-2757Graduate Information: (510) 643-7224Visiting Scholars: (510) 643-7224Fax: (510) 643-5688Copyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyApprentices will:Mentors will:The department will:BLS CogNetwork*dhworomFieldwork Forum Language and Cognition LabPhonetics and Phonology ForumPhonLabScript Encoding InitiativeSurvey of California and Other Indian LanguagesSyntax & Semantics CircleDepartment AddressUniversity of California, BerkeleyDepartment of Linguistics1203 Dwinelle Hall #2650Berkeley, CA 94720-2650Department Emaillinginfo@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail)PhoneGeneral Information: (510) 642-2757Undergraduate Information: (510) 642-2757Graduate Information: (510) 643-7224Visiting Scholars: (510) 643-7224Fax: (510) 643-5688Copyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe Linguistics major consists of a five-course core and 10 upper division units of Electives. The five core courses are:Linguistics majors must pass all five core courses and maintain a C average overall in the major. Students who do not do so may be dropped from the major.Ling 110, Ling 120, Ling 115 and Ling 130 are offered only once per year. Scheduling must, therefore, be done carefully. Students needing to complete the major in their last four semesters (the situation for most transfer students) are advised to follow this schedule:Transfer students who have taken linguistics courses at other institutions should consult the Undergraduate Advisors to see whether they can count towards the major. In any case, all Linguistics majors must take Ling 100, Ling 110, 115, 120 and Ling 130 at UC Berkeley.In addition to the five core courses, 10 upper division units of electives, taken for a letter grade, are required. Five of the elective units must be selected from upper-division course offerings within the Linguistics Department; the remaining units may be courses from other departments, subject to the approval of the Linguistics Department. List of pre-approved courses in other departments that can count as electives towards the Linguistics Major.As the range of possible electives is so wide, the focus of the major may vary considerably from student to student. Frequently chosen topical groupings of elective courses are: linguistic methods and theory; Indo-European studies; the structure of a language or language group; an area connecting linguistics with some related discipline such as anthropology, philosophy, psychology, sociolinguistics, computer science or rhetoric.In concert with departmental undergraduate learning goals, students are strongly advised to include at least one writing-intensive course in their elective options. Examples of writing-intensive Linguistics electives include C105, 106, 123, 124, 142, 150, 151, and 181. It is usual for at least one of these courses to be offered each semester.Freshmen and Lower-division students who want to explore the major are encouraged to take the following courses:It is important that students plan their program of study with a departmental Undergraduate Advisor, who can assist in planning the timing of required courses and in the selection of electives.In addition to attaining a basic mastery of the field of linguistics, linguistics majors develop skills in critical thinking, in communication, and in the use of research methodologies. The array of courses offered by the Department includes both the required "core" courses in Phonetics and Phonology, Syntax and Semantics, Morphology, and Historical Linguistics, and a broad range of electives. The core courses allow linguistics majors to master the basics of the discipline, such as the nature of sounds and sound systems, the nature of word structures and syntactic structures, the interaction of syntax and semantics, and the nature of linguistic change, while the elective courses allow students to investigate areas of particular interest. Students learn to apply problem-solving skills in each of these areas. Perhaps more important, a linguistics major develops critical thinking skills. By graduation, linguistics majors can employ both theory and empirical evidence in order to evaluate different linguistic arguments, analyze complex linguistic patterns, and understand the role played by assumptions in argumentation. Further, linguistics majors develop advanced verbal skills; they are able to communicate effectively in oral and written form about specific linguistic issues, and they can produce well-organized oral presentations and original written reports supported by empirical evidence. These skills do not disappear at graduation; no matter what profession a linguistics major decides to pursue, throughout a lifetime s/he will possess a working knowledge of sources of reliable information about languages and linguistics and will be able to understand and evaluate current linguistic issues in the world at large. Below is a list of more specific goals, with information about which courses fulfil them. Courses shown in boldface are specifically devoted to the learning goal in question.These skills are introduced in Ling 5 and Ling 100 and reinforced in the core classes (Ling 110, 115, 120, 130) as well as in most upper division electives.A goal of the linguistics major is for students to learn how to obtain and collect relevant data using specific qualitative and/or quantitative research methods. These goals are broken down further, and the classes in which they are reinforced are listed, below:A learning goal of the major is for students to apply problem-solving skills to complex problems in a variety of subareas of linguistics. These goals are broken down further, and the classes in which they are reinforced are listed, below:A goal of the linguistics major is for students to communicate their knowledge effectively. The subgoals, listed below, are introduced in Ling 5 and 100, in the form of weekly written assignments and discussion sections where student participation is expected. The first two goals are reinforced in virtually every core and elective course. The second two vary by course and instructor and year. The last is reinforced in the writing-intensive electives, which include Ling 106, 123, 124, 142, 150, 151, and 181.A goal of the major is for students to acquire knowledge and analytical abilities that they can transfer from the classroom to their broader life during and after their university career. This goal is not the dedicated topic of any one class; rather, it is a generalized aim of all classes in linguistics to relate the topics covered to students' lives in the world.Several capstone experiences are available to Linguistics majors, as a means of integrating the skills and knowledge gained in the major into a significant intellectual product or experience. Students may elect to write an honors thesis, in which they work with an advisor on a year-long research project which they write up in the form of a thesis. Students may participate in faculty research projects, ranging from laboratory experiments to fieldwork with a consultant. Certain classes (e.g. Ling 113, 140, 170) are routinely devoted to developing student-led research projects. Aside from capstone experiences, learning goals for the major are assessed in the classroom through regular written assignments. The core classes for the major all revolve around weekly homework assignments in which students solve complex problems and write up their solutions in a professional manner. Students receive feedback on their analyses and their presentation skills. Most electives require a term paper or similar assignment. Few linguistics classes use multiple-choice tests; by the end of the major, students have had significant experience at high-grade linguistic analysis, argumentation and exposition.BLS CogNetwork*dhworomFieldwork Forum Language and Cognition LabPhonetics and Phonology ForumPhonLabScript Encoding InitiativeSurvey of California and Other Indian LanguagesSyntax & Semantics CircleDepartment AddressUniversity of California, BerkeleyDepartment of Linguistics1203 Dwinelle Hall #2650Berkeley, CA 94720-2650Department Emaillinginfo@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail)PhoneGeneral Information: (510) 642-2757Undergraduate Information: (510) 642-2757Graduate Information: (510) 643-7224Visiting Scholars: (510) 643-7224Fax: (510) 643-5688Copyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyA minor in Linguistics gives students official recognition for having completed a Linguistics sub-specialization.
