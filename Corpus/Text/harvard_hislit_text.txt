From the birth of the welfare state to the rise of Thatcherism, from post-colonial migration to multicultural Britain, from the Swinging Sixties to punk rock and riots, we will track these radical political, social and cultural changes through novels, poetry, theater, film, pop music, photography, fashion, food and sport. We will explore the way Britain sought to retain its influence in the world, through its involvement in the Cold War, its relations with the Commonwealth, and its continuing ‘special relationship’ with the United States, even as what being English or British began to change in meaning. As well as reading literary works by Philip Larkin, Jean Rhys, JG Ballard, Salman Rushdie, China Miéville, and Zadie Smith, we will consider the nation’s popular culture, from The Beatles to The Sex Pistols, from James Bond to J.K. Rowling.

This class pushes us to consider how marginalized individuals and communities also used the same arenas to resist and critique colonial subjugation.

AdlerMeeting time: Wednesday, 3-5This course offers a history of the United States and the Cold War through films made during the conflict. We will examine the Cold War through two themes which drove much U.S. Cold War policymaking, from McCarthyism to Vietnam. The first theme is subversion: the fear that the United States (or our allies) would be quietly infiltrated by Communists and other radicals who would seize power “from the inside.” The second theme is insurgency: the fear of a violent uprising by marginalized communities that would weaken or overthrow free world institutions.

This seminar historicizes meritocracy as an ideal and practice by focusing on Harvard University since the Civil War. Throughout this period, Harvard has seen its role as training a meritorious elite to lead society. We will study the historical politics of this elitism in the context of class, race, gender, capitalism, and mass democracy.

The course traces along zones of passage that limit, regulate, and control mobility (including frontiers, enclosures, walls, barbed wire, among others) and theories of the distribution of the sensible (including security, circulation, flow, among others). We will traverse multiple fields of analysis where these terms have been illuminated, including science/geography (space, place, land), social science (zone, territory, state) and the arts/humanities (identity, subjectivity, memory). ARTS COMPONENT: Students will engage with works of art relating to the seminar’s themes and produce works of art of their own. No previous experience in the arts is expected or assumed, and a process-based approach to making work in any medium is encouraged. Students are provided with a small materials budget, shared access to studio space, arts-making workshops, and open studio sessions.

While the US’s emergence as the leader in incarceration rates is relatively recent, the prison has loomed large in American public life for 200 years. In this class, we will approach the prison not as a marginal phenomenon, but as an institution central to American culture. Readings include works of literature by and about prisoners as well as reformers’ pamphlets, sociological studies, government reports, and inmate manifestos. We will trace debates about freedom and captivity from the birth of the penitentiary through the era of mass incarceration.

This interdisciplinary seminar explores public commemoration of the Revolution through various media, from the Bunker Hill Monument and “Paul Revere’s Ride” to Bicentennial protest literature and the lyrics of Lin-Manuel Miranda. Assignments include a scavenger hunt for local memorials and a field trip to the Freedom Trail.

In the span of only a few decades, the role of computers in American society dramatically transformed from a complex tool serving the aims of the military to a children’s toy found in the domestic space of the American home. How did authors and filmmakers make sense of this dramatic transformation? We will engage with cultural sources ranging from classic midcentury novels and educational films, to Looney Tunes cartoons and DC Comics in order to formulate answers to this question. Course includes film screenings and field trips.

AlworthMeeting time: Wednesday, 3-5This course tracks the history of design from the Industrial Revolution to the digital revolution in the United States, and it gives sustained attention to the relationship between this history and American literature, broadly conceived. At least since Edgar Allan Poe published his “Philosophy of Furniture” in 1840, American authors have engaged with the objects and ideas of design thinking. Such engagement has taken many different forms since the mid-nineteenth century: simultaneous attraction to and repulsion from the technological, the industrial, and the machine; obsession with the distinctions among art, craft, and decoration; fascination with cities as designed spaces and with literary art as a designed (if not exactly designer) thing; and attention to the poetics of fashion, advertising, shopping, décor, bric-a-brac, trash, and other superficial matters.

We will explore how beauty is used to manage bodies, define social hierarchies, and gain or maintain power. We will also investigate how presentations of beauty could also be used as forms of subversion and resistance. Looking at sites such beauty pageants, cosmetic consumer cultures, drag performances, cosmetic surgery, and the transnational production and consumption of beauty vloggers we will investigate how race, gender, sexuality, and class informs definitions of beauty and how definitions of beauty inform constructions of race, gender, sexuality, and class.

In response to these reductive constructions, Asian Americans have crafted their own dynamic cultural expressions in a number of media—from film, television, and music to fashion, sports, and food—that reveal the broad complexity of Asian America and contest the contradictions of the U.S. nation-state. Asian American culture also uniquely sits at the nexus of immigration flows and digital technologies, providing a transnational lens to view the US’s place in the world. This seminar, then, will introduce students to the study and practice of Asian American culture as heterogeneous, hybrid, and multiple. In doing so, students will gain an understanding of the shifting and interlocking tensions among the local, the national, and the global that form the cultural geographies of Asian America.

	This course will examine the world of ideas that has shaped Latin America. It is designed to provide students with the necessary tools to think critically about topics such as nationalism, capitalism, literary criticism, historiography, political and economic theory, identity politics, modernity, colonialism/postcolonialism, gender, and many other topics that have shaped intellectual debates in Latin America and all over the world. We will labor at the intersection where literature, history, politics, theories and practices meet. This course will examine ideas and the practices they inform, as well as practices and the ideas that sustain them, as products of human culture that can be contested and changed.

	This course will explore the history of Afro-Latin American culture as expressed through literature, music, dance, and religious and spiritual practices. Beginning with an analysis of the theoretical framework of the African diaspora, we will ask central questions around how and why African heritage has been celebrated or rendered invisible in Latin America. We will also consider where ideas of homeland and displacement shift with experiences of migration and in borderland regions. Themes of racialized and gendered experience will be discussed as well as systems of racism, oppression, cultural imperialism, and individual and collective agency within this history. The rich diversity of Afro-Latin American cultures will be highlighted in both the Caribbean and South America, as well as in sites of connection and convergence such as New York City, Havana, and Panamá.

	“More than one billion people in the world live on less than a dollar a day.” “For the past thirty years development policy has been dominated by the paradigm of export-led growth.” Sentences such as these epitomize how often we think of global economic inequalities in terms of abstracted concepts. In this course, we will highlight another analytical lens: people's lives. Using films, novels, memoirs, and more, this course examines the history of attempts by everyone from sweatshop workers to presidents to create a more equitable global economy from the 1940s to the present.

	 The Frankfurt School was a group of intellectuals who first started writing in Germany in the tumultuous period between the two World Wars. They sought to understand why modernity had led not to progress, as earlier social theorists such as Marx had hoped, but to fascism, Stalinism, and an ever-morepowerful capitalism. Where earlier Marxists had focused on economics and politics as the key sites of domination and resistance, the Frankfurt School turned to culture. Cultural forms such as radio, film, marriage, and even the concept of “free time,” they held, shaped people’s desires, beliefs, and hopes, reconciling them to a social order that hurt them. Unmasking culture’s complicity, the Frankfurt School believed, was not only a method for understanding the world but also a way of loosening domination’s grip. This course surveys some of the Frankfurt School’s most enduring works of cultural criticism. Topics include mass culture, aesthetics, sexuality, the psyche, politics, and critique.

	This course examines the history of deportation in American society, and considers how the policing, exclusion, and expulsion of immigrant populations has shaped the nation. Through historical texts, primary sources, literature, and popular culture, we will cover a wide range of topics including racial quotas, guestworker expulsions, labor control, racialized health panics, national security scares, the disproportionate removal of black immigrants, the growth of immigrant detention, the criminalization of immigrant communities, and immigrant rights activism. Although mass deportation is often understood as a recent phenomenon, this course will demonstrate the ways that immigration control stretches as far back as creation of the United States. We will trace shifting opinions about immigration, the meaning of citizenship, statelessness, and national belonging.

	This course examines the politics of fashion among people of African descent during slavery and the period immediately followed emancipation. Fashion is generative, yet underutilized analytic to explore the experience of the enslaved and their descendants. Geographical breadth is crucial to examining the African Diaspora in its full complexity; therefore, course material will cover the United States, Caribbean, Latin America, and Africa. We will examine in particular the relationship between slave consumerism and the development of modern capitalism in the Atlantic World. Other topics of the course will include: sumptuary law, wealth accumulation among the enslaved and formally enslaved, honor and respectability politics, commodification of the enslaved, gendered sartorial expression, etc.

	This class examines the relationship between popular music, American literature, and the power structures that organize life in the United States. We will study the ways that music constructs social identities by considering how popular music—in performance, on record, and in written representation—can both reinforce and challenge hierarchies of gender, race, region, sexuality, class, and citizenship. Listening to recording artists such as Johnny Cash, Frank Ocean, Beyoncé, and Kendrick Lamar, we will learn how music plays a critical role in producing the social distinctions that popular culture is often presumed simply to reflect. Moreover, our study of literature by Alice Walker, Mary Gaitskill, Essex Hemphill, and others will show how the literary representation of sound can both articulate the pleasures and resist the injustices of an often-inadequate present moment.

	The story of the African diaspora begins with, and continues to be shaped by, travel. If, as Angela Davis posits, the ability to travel was one of the most significant ways that “emancipation radically transformed personal lives” of formerly enslaved people, this seminar seeks to consider all of the ways that black people in the Americas exercised this newfound freedom in the twentieth century. This course begins with the narratives of enslaved Africans detailing their forced migration to the New World, and ends with the speculative black narratives of space travel and future utopias in which “walking while black” is no longer a crime. From the world travels of Harlem Renaissance intellectuals like Langston Hughes and Claude McKay, to the waves of decolonization that pushed black migrants to leave their homes in Africa and the Caribbean, this course explores the tensions between a fraught history of coerced migration and a tempting possibility of leisured wandering.

	The 1980s saw the convergence of American politics and economics to strengthen U.S. interests abroad, but the decade was also a moment of enormous social, political, and economic divergence at home. How compatible—or causal—was the end of the cold war with the end of the American cultural consensus? Did such a consensus ever exist, or was it a mere illusion and nostalgia for a “simpler time”? This course will look at how culture—including novels, films, plays, music videos, and more—both shapes and is shaped by social and political attitudes. As the 1980s experiences a pop culture comeback in the 2010s, how do we begin to critically make sense of a decade of contradictions?

	Russiagate, Emailgate, Benghazigate: these are the latest in a series of scandals and pseudo-scandals bearing the suffix that originates in the name of the Washington hotel where, in the summer of 1972, burglars associated with the Committee to Re-Elect the President broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The subsequent cover-up and revelations of a myriad of crimes and abuses of power by the Nixon White House and previous administrations, abbreviated as “Watergate,” reshaped U.S. political culture in the 1970s and resonate into our own time. Corrupt power, secrecy, surveillance, and paranoia suffuse these works. In this course, we will explore how Watergate figured into canonical works of popular culture, especially Hollywood movies, in the first half of the 1970s. They speak to a pervasive distrust of American institutions—especially government—that extended across the political spectrum. Watergate will be our entry point into a wide-ranging engagement with the cultural history of the 1970s and its legacies in the present. Filmmakers and authors include Francis Ford Coppola, Sidney Lumet, Barbara Kopple, Alan J. Pakula, Ivan Dixon, Robert Altman, Roman Polanski, Martin Scorsese, Mary McCarthy, Elizabeth Drew, Kurt Vonnegut, Ursula K. LeGuin, Gore Vidal, Carl Bernstein, and Bob Woodward.

	The current humanitarian disasters in the Middle East and North Africa have brought the plight of refugees in the region to the fore. Taking a long-term historical perspective, this course explores the centrality of migrants and refugees to the formation of the modern Middle East. Drawing on multiple cases of migration and displacement from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, we will investigate historical processes that resulted in the uprooting of diverse populations throughout the broader Middle East. Topics include war (inter-state and civil), population transfers and exchanges, voluntary and forced migration, assimilation and integration, and exile and memory. We will explore these themes by drawing on diverse primary sources such as fiction, poetry, memoirs, music, photography, and film.

	This course explores the history of race relations, civil rights, and youth cultures post WWII through the lens of music history. Although overtime, African American contributions to American Music have become more and more recognized, Latino contributions to popular music in the United States have mostly been relegated to the margins of a narrative dominat-ed by an overly black and white view of musical history. Latin music is often portrayed as an exotic resource for "American" musicians. Often seen as purely foreign music, this course turns that perspective on its head. We will document the roles of U.S. Latino musicians as interpreters of Latin American genres, as well as their roles as innovators within genres normally considered non-Latino music: R&B, jazz, Rock & Roll, country/western, punk and hip hop. In this course, we examine how the sensibility and musical creativity of urban youth, in very different historical periods, inspired musical revolutions which transformed the tastes of entire generations, crossing boundaries of race, gender, nation and social class.

	In this course, we will consider the literary and cultural history of American museums from the eighteenth century to the present. Throughout the semester, we will discuss how museums have functioned as both centers for research and as public spaces for education and entertainment, and how such priorities have evolved over the past few centuries, shaped by new ideas about conservation, education, and access. How do we determine the authenticity and value of art objects and natural specimens? How have museums informed debates over national politics and cultural authority? And how do museum collections create narratives about national and natural history? We will explore these and other questions through a range of sources, including fiction and poetry, visual and material culture, and periodicals and museum guidebooks, as well as visits to Harvard’s own varied museum collections and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.

	Why do we take the history of Euro-American psychiatry as the barometer against which we understand all other histories of madness? Is there a larger narrative of insanity that doesn’t use the Greenwich Meridian as the centre of the world? To give students the tools to answer these questions, this course uses underutilized literature from South Africa, the Pacific Islands, and South Asia as the roots of a new kind of canon. Students will grapple with the history of madness in three registers -- individual, community, and transnational. Within these registers lies a more pressing issue: can we consider colonialism itself a form of madness? Students will unpack a historical and literary madness that removes the centrality of the Euro-American story and creates a global story where the ‘mad’ are not simply a racial ‘other’.

	This seminar explores roles women have played in wars for independence across the French-speaking world. As the Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo depicts in his iconic film, The Battle of Algiers (1966), some women fought alongside men carrying bombs in the fight for freedom from the French in Algeria. However, more often, women have forged their own paths parallel to men enacting complex forms of resistance through art, mobilizing domesticity, and protest. Using women in the French Revolution as our starting point, we will engage with women who resist the reductive fantasy of the female freedom fighter throughout the French-speaking world with an emphasis on the case of Algeria. Figures under our investigative lens include Olympe de Gouges who proclaimed a “Declaration of the Rights of Women” in France, Assia Djebar who depicted women playing new roles outside of the home in Algeria, and Lina Mhenni who used social media in Tunisia to show the world injustice taking place under a repressive regime in 2010. Alongside these memoirs, literary texts, historical documents, and films by and about women at war, we will develop a critical vocabulary of women at work reading theorists that include Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Gayatri Spivak, and Judith Butler. Over the course of the semester, we will put these voices in conversation with one another in order to reconstruct alternative histories of resisting oppression in the francophone world and beyond.

	In the last generation, scholars have revolutionized our understanding of slavery and freedom in the modern Atlantic world. This sea-change has been the result of a major methodological shift: to view this history through the eyes of slaves rather than the eyes of masters. This course will examine the history of the "black Atlantic" through a diverse range of cultural texts--poetry, pamphlets, court cases, petitions, autobiographies, novels, speeches, and sermons--produced by slaves, free blacks, and abolitionists from the Age of Revolution to emancipation.

We will see works of art deployed for all sorts of political purposes, some of which had very little to do with their creators’ intentions. Throughout, we will consider how art is shaped by the politics of race, class, gender, sexuality, and national identity, and how it shapes these things in turn.

Death is universal and inevitable, but how we experience it over time and how people have understood in the past and in the present differs according to time, place, location, ethnicity, race, religious belief, and many other cultural, political and social factors. This course examines the history of death in the American context, through a wide range of historical and literary sources. It is arranged in rough chronological order, but our emphasis throughout will be tracing how death has been used to categorize and shape people’s collective and individual identities. Each unit will provide opportunities for you to analyze a range of developments in history and literature – such as slavery, environmental history, political organization, and social protest – and a variety of textual genres including short stories, poetry, philosophy, journalism, photography, and cultural objects.

We will consider how London became a world city in the Victorian era, and the ways in which this status was projected, from the Great Exhibition of 1851 to the 2012 Olympics. Through our reading of wide range of cultural forms, including novels, poems, films, graphic novels, photography, maps, posters, popular music, food and fashion, we will explore the city’s fluid identity, and the ways in which it was imagined by locals and visitors. In some weeks we focus on specific historical moments and in others take a more thematic approach but the overall goals will be the same: to understand how the city has been mythologized and reinvented by its rapidly changing population.

We will do so from  transnational perspectives, discussing the utopias and dystopias imagined by writers of all backgrounds and views without incorporating how they found inspiration and terror in looking at other societies. We will investigate traditional examples of utopias and dystopias--from planned communes to futuristic totalitarian regimes--at the same time that we will test the boundaries of utopian and dystopian definitions. Throughout, we will ask  questions of these genres such as: how have utopian and dystopian stories illuminated fears around changing economic structures, gender dynamics, and race relations? In what ways do utopias and dystopias offer insight into ideals of individualism and fears of conformity? What aspects of United States history have unfolded as real-life utopias and dystopias? And how distinct are the concepts of utopia and dystopia? We will explore these questions through a wide range of texts, from novels to films to manifestos to plays to sermons.

              Their planned speeches explain how to overcome fear, remain hopeful, and stay bewilderedFile photo by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff PhotographerCommencement Day student orators Auguste "Gussie" Roc, Jessica Glueck, and Walter Smelt III were chosen in a speech-writing competition to address Harvard’s Class of 2017. Continuing a cherished tradition that dates back more than 360 years, three students will deliver orations to the Class of 2017 during Morning Exercises at Commencement.The students, who were chosen by a panel of judges during a speech-writing competition, are two Harvard College seniors and a graduate student from Harvard Divinity School. They will deliver their orations, one in Latin and two in English, before graduates, family, friends, and members of the Harvard community in Tercentenary Theatre.Once, students delivered orations to defend their theses. But now they seek to inspire their peers with messages of encouragement. This year’s topics address how to overcome fear, how to remain hopeful, and how to be properly bewildered.Here are this year’s orators:Jessica Rachael Glueck, Latin speakerJessica Glueck ’17 traces her love for Latin back to high school. Sitting around the dinner table in her hometown of Leawood, a Kansas City suburb, Glueck’s father would preach the benefits of learning Latin as a way to understand English better. Glueck obliged and signed up for a class in the language, which she grew to love.Fast forward to today.An English concentrator with a secondary in classics, Glueck will give the Latin oration. She still can’t believe it. Neither can her father.“I was talking to my dad the other day,” said Glueck during an interview at the coffee shop at the Harvard Art Museums, one of her favorite campus hangouts. “If someone would have told us when I was in high school that I’d be at Harvard, and I’d be giving the Latin oration, neither of us would have believed it. It went further than either of us ever expected.”Like a modern Latin poet, Glueck will address her class outdoors, in Tercentenary Theatre, to sing the praises of her Harvard years as they come to an end. In her speech, “Epos Imperfectus,” “The Unfinished Epic,” she plans to eulogize the quest for learning, the callings found, and the friendships she and her classmates formed over four years.But unlike Ovid and other ancient Roman poets whom she learned to admire, Glueck plans to include an admonition that she hopes will help her fellow graduating seniors. It is a message inspired by Virgil, who on his deathbed ordered his masterpiece “The Aeneid” to be burned because, in his view, it was unfinished.“Even if we stand at the end of our Harvard years, some of us may be thinking of things we would have done differently, of things we’d like to go back and change,” she said. “But it’s good to remember that this is actually the first book of our epic, and that we could do better in the next book.”Glueck’s next book, for instance, will start in September, when she will begin classics studies at the University of Oxford. She hopes eventually to teach Latin and English to inspire others to study the classics, which, she said, can enrich people’s understanding of today’s world. “Classic antiquity is an intellectual touchstone for so many different cultures,” she said.Learning Latin helped Glueck become a better writer, she said, by familiarizing her with the roots of words, syntax, and clauses. In the process, she also read books that delved into a broad range of human emotions and desires that still resonate today, and was delighted by the authors’ wit.
“People forget the ancients have a great sense of humor,” she said.Echoing that trait, Glueck will inject humor into her speech, which the audience will be able to follow because the Latin text will be accompanied by an English translation in the Commencement program. “Some people may think Latin is a language of somber philosophy, but it’s not,” said Glueck. “It’s such a triumph to be able to communicate in a language that we no longer speak.”The Mather House resident said her message will be that the best is yet to come, or as she says in Latin, “Opus nostrum solum hodie incipit” — “Our masterpiece only begins today.”Auguste “Gussie” Roc, undergraduate speakerGussie Roc ’17 drew inspiration for her Commencement speech from two startling events that left a mark on her life and the lives of her graduating classmates.Like most of her peers, Roc was in first grade when the Sept. 11 terror attacks took place. And like most of them, she was a high school senior when the Boston Marathon bombings happened. The attacks marked the beginning and the end of the Class of 2017’s elementary and secondary school years, and brought uncertainty and fear into their lives.In her speech, “When We Fall in One Piece,” Roc will talk about the ways fear can be overcome.“Having gone through these difficult moments or scary times,” said Roc, a Pforzheimer resident, “I realized that what’s important is to recognize each other’s humanity and understand that whether or not we have commonalities, we’re one people.”A Brooklyn native, Roc said that seeing acts of compassion and bravery in the midst of those two attacks helped her to “take every day as a blessing” and “try to be somebody who does active good in the world.”An American history and literature concentrator, Roc plans to pursue a career in filmmaking or screenwriting. At Harvard, she rediscovered a love for films and writing after trying classes in government, economics, and statistics, and finding out they were not for her. In her sophomore year, she co-directed the Harvard College Film Festival, and in the summer of 2014 she traveled to Berlin as a film studies and production student. She also worked as a producer at the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club, served as a leader at the Freshman Arts Program, and as a president of the Signet Society, a social club where students and faculty celebrate the arts and humanities.Fanning her passions, she took courses on playwriting, screenwriting, and autobiography and memoir, and she wrote a play she performed in class, one of the highlights of her College years. “I came full circle,” she said. “I went back to the things I wanted to pursue from the beginning.”She hopes to write screenplays about stories and people overlooked by mainstream culture and off the beaten path. Two films that she finds inspiring are “Beasts of the Southern Wild” and “Little Miss Sunshine,” small independent movies that were highly acclaimed by critics and had success in the box office.“For everyone who feels their story doesn’t matter,” she said, “there are examples out there of stories that might have not been told. Not only can those stories be told, but also they can be successful at the box office and show the diversity of life.”After graduation, Roc plans to move to New York or Los Angeles and write a screenplay that tells an important story about an unnoticed topic or marginalized people. She will depart with her best memories of Harvard, including the friendships she made and the courses that reignited her vocation in the arts. She will remember seeing towering figures such as Civil Rights leader and U.S. Rep. John Lewis and Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, both of whom stood “in the face of fear.” She’ll also remember having given a speech to her departing classmates.“It’s an honor,” she said. “But what’s really important for me is that my speech talks about how our basic humanity is being threatened, and what we, as world leaders and world changers, can do to preserve it.”Walter Smelt III, graduate speakerAs a poet working on his first manuscript, Walter Smelt III said jokingly that he often feels like he’s talking into empty air. But Smelt, who will speak on behalf of the graduate students, will have a massive audience at Commencement.It will be the second time Smelt addresses a university audience. In 2007, Smelt was the undergraduate speaker at Boston University’s commencement. He spoke then about the need to “inhabit the earth.” This year, as a graduate of the Harvard Divinity School with a master’s of theological studies in religion, literature, and culture, his planned message will be for graduates to stop being clever and instead let themselves “be bewildered.”“Harvard has a tradition of excellence firmly established,” said Smelt. “But that’s all the more reason to have humility, admit the limitations of our knowledge, and the need to become bewildered. It’s important to question, and not always get the answer.”It is a lesson that Smelt said he learned at the Divinity School, where there is a tradition of deep analysis alongside the accumulation of knowledge. Ethics, or knowing what’s right and what’s wrong, is equally important.“At the Divinity School, I learned that there are things beyond knowledge; there is wisdom,” he said. “Science is really important, but it’s also important to remember that you can know everything in the world and not know what you shouldn’t do. There are still ethical considerations to be made.”Smelt, who earned a master’s in creative writing from the University of Florida in Gainesville, came to the Divinity School to look at literature from the perspective of faith and to explore the intersection of religion and literature, both of which have long been part of his life.Growing up in a religious family in West Palm Beach, Fla., Smelt became fascinated by books, including the Bible, which he saw both as a sacred document and as a wondrous piece of literature with “tremendous power to shape people’s lives.”A high school teacher introduced him to poetry, and Smelt found a passion. He is working on a book of poems, many of which deal with religious subjects such as the exploration of faith and doubt, and which exhibit religious imagery. “Religion keeps finding its way in my poems,” he said.Smelt hopes to teach creative writing in the future. Meantime, he tries to practice what he preaches and let himself be bewildered. He keeps himself connected to the real world, outside the ivory tower, by dog sitting, working at an after-school program, and freelancing as a writer.“It’s important to me to recognize the limits of my knowledge,” he said, “and go out, do some good, and engage with the world.”File photo by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff PhotographerCommencement Day student orators Auguste "Gussie" Roc, Jessica Glueck, and Walter Smelt III were chosen in a speech-writing competition to address Harvard’s Class of 2017.

              Cox and Peña honored for undergraduate teachingPhotos: Courtesy of the Department of Romance Languages & Literature; Jon Chase/Harvard Staff PhotographerLorgia García Peña and David Cox, both assistant professors with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, have each won a 2017 Roslyn Abramson Award for excellence in undergraduate teaching.David Cox, assistant professor of molecular and cellular biology and of computer science, uses cutting-edge, high-performance computing techniques to teach undergraduates how the brain works. Lorgia García Peña, assistant professor of Romance languages and literatures and of history and literature, teaches students about ethnic, race, and national identity formations through literature. This year, the two members of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) have something in common: They’re both winners of a 2017 Roslyn Abramson Award for excellence in undergraduate teaching.“David Cox’s and Lorgia García Peña’s love of teaching exemplifies a Harvard education at its best,” said Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith. “Each have engaged and challenged students in the classroom and the lab, ignited students’ passion for their respective fields, and prepared them to lead in a complex world. I offer my congratulations to David and Lorgia for an honor well-deserved.”The $10,000 award, established with a gift from Edward Abramson ’57 in honor of his mother, is given annually in recognition of “excellence and sensitivity in teaching undergraduates.” Recipients, drawn exclusively from FAS, are chosen on the basis of their ability to communicate with and inspire undergraduates, their accessibility, and their dedication to teaching.David CoxCox said he was honored when he found out that he was a recipient of this year’s Abramson Award.“I am grateful to my department and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to have been given the flexibility and resources to explore new ideas in teaching so early in my career,” he said. “I’m also grateful to the students whom I’ve taught so far — their curiosity and enthusiasm makes my course a joy to teach.”Cox teaches one course, “Fundamentals of Neuroscience.” It’s an intensive introduction to topics in neuroscience, ranging from the inner workings of neurons to the function of small neuronal networks to the function of brain systems that give rise to perception, thought, emotion, cognition, and action. The course is tailored for highly engaged students who are interested in pursuing a neurobiology concentration or secondary.What makes this course unique, however, is that it’s taught in a “flipped classroom” format.“Students complete lessons from the HarvardX online version of the course outside of class, and then 100 percent of in-class time is devoted to discussion and student-driven synthesis of material,” explained Cox. “This course represents the fruition of a multiyear arc that I’ve been developing since I arrived at Harvard, aimed at fusing online and on-campus learning.”In addition to reaching learners globally, HarvardX has worked to identify opportunities to leverage its online learning content in Harvard’s on-campus classes — and has helped create more than 20 blended courses at the University using HarvardX materials.“I’m convinced that online courses can be a powerful tool for making the on-campus experience more personalized and interactive,” said Cox. “In my course, students get all of the nuts-and-bolts learning out of the way outside of class, using lessons that were designed to be fun, visually engaging, and easily digestible, and in-class time is all about students solidifying that knowledge and exploring topics in greater depth.”As for the award money, Cox intends to use part of it as seed capital to help one of his graduate students launch a startup based on technology developed in the coxlab @ Harvard University.Lorgia García PeñaUndergraduates find that García Peña’s “Performing Latinidad” questions Latinidad as a historical, cultural, and theoretical concept through literary and critical texts.“One of the goals of the course is to provide students with an overview of the Latinx literary canon in dialogue with the various historical and social moments and movements that produced them — the War of 1898, the Jones Act of 1917, the Civil Rights Movement(s), the Delano strikes, the Zoot Suit Riots, and Operation Bootstrap,” said García Peña.The course includes an art component in which the students, working in groups, produce an art piece that is then displayed throughout campus. Thanks to generous support of the Elson Family, García Peña has been able to invite artists to work with students in developing their pieces.García Peña believes strongly that learning done in the classroom should not be disconnected from what is happening in the world around us.“I encourage my students to read in contradiction, always looking for silences, omissions, blank spaces,” she said. “I think we all have that responsibility as scholars, and particularly as humanists, as much damage has been done by reading the same way — many histories and knowledge have been suppressed, erased from our archives to the detriment of our society.”García Peña said she was incredibly humbled and grateful to her colleagues and students in accepting the award, focusing on her love of teaching and the rewards it brings.“I learn so much from my students, everyday,” she said. “I am enriched by the discussion — particularly the challenging ones. It is a wonderful exchange.”Photos: Courtesy of the Department of Romance Languages & Literature; Jon Chase/Harvard Staff PhotographerLorgia García Peña and David Cox, both assistant professors with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, have each won a 2017 Roslyn Abramson Award for excellence in undergraduate teaching.Sunil Amrith, the Mehra Family Professor of South Asian Studies, has been awarded a MacArthur “Genius” Grant.
