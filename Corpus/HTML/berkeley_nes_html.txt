    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions about NES Graduate Admissions</h3>
							<p>1.<strong> Does the Department admit students for fall and spring semesters?</strong><br>
						    The Department admits new students for the fall term only.</p>
							<p>2. <strong>What is the application deadline?</strong><br>
						  The deadline for the applications is December 15. Late or incomplete materials submitted after the December 15 will not be considered.</p>
							<p>3. <strong>How do I obtain application forms?</strong><br>
						  You can apply online by filling out the secure application form at (http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/index.shtml).</p>
							<p>4. <strong>How to I apply if I was registered before at Berkeley as a graduate student?</strong><br>
						  If you were registered before as a graduate student at Berkeley, you will have to complete an Application for Readmission form instead. Readmission applicants may be in competition with applicants for admission. If you are applying to a different major from the one that you were last registered, you will have to complete a Graduate Petition for Change of Major or Degree Goal. These forms are available at (http://registrar.berkeley.edu/GeneralInfo/elecforms.html). For additional requirements or information please contact the department.</p>
							<p>5. <strong>I applied last year and plan to reapply this year. Do I have to submit everything again?</strong><br>
						  You have to resubmit the Graduate Application form and pay the application fee. If you have completed any course work since your last application, you will have to upload copies of your updated transcripts.</p>
							<p>6. <strong>Which application materials should be submitted directly to the department?</strong><br>
							  All application materials (including statement of purpose, college/university level transcripts, writing sample, and 3 letters of recommendation) should be uploaded to the Graduate Division's online application system.<br>
						  TOEFL scores (if applicable) are submitted electronically after the test is taken.</p>
							<p>7. <strong>Do I need to take the GRE in order to apply to the graduate program in Near Eastern Studies?</strong> <br>
							  No. The Department of Near Eastern Studies doesn't take GRE scores into consideration when deciding whether to admit applicants to our program. If you are also applying to other departments on the Berkeley campus - or to other universities - please be sure to check their requirements because those programs might ask for different application materials.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Who is required to take TOEFL test?</strong><br>
						  Students from countries in which the official language is not English, are required to take the TOEFL test; however, students who have completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a U.S. university do not need to take the TOEFL test.</p>
							<p>9. <strong>How long are the TOEFL test scores valid?</strong><br>
						  The TOEFL must have been taken within the past two years. Tests taken before the month of June of two years prior in which admission is thought will not be accepted.</p>
							<p>10. <strong>Where should the TOEFL test scores be reported?</strong><br>
						  For reporting the TOEFL scores, the UC Berkeley code is 4833 and the department code may be given as 2999 (Humanities) or 0000 (Other). TOEFL scores are reported electronically.</p>
							<p>11. <strong>What is the last date that I can take the TOEFL?</strong><br>
						  You should plan on taking the exam no later than by the end of November. Taking the exam at a later date may put your application at a disadvantage.</p>
							<p>12. <strong>What are the minimum TOEFL scores required for admission?</strong><br>
						  The most recent total score on the Internet-based TOEFL must be at least 90 out of 120.</p>
							<p>13. <strong>What is the minimum required GPA for admission and how does the department calculate GPA?</strong><br>
						  Applicants must have a minimum of 3.0 GPA for the undergraduate work completed after the first 2 years of their study, or in 2 years or more of master’s or doctoral level study. For international applicants the GPA is calculated using all years of their work for their degree.</p>
							<p>14. <strong>Can you tell me more about the writing sample?</strong><br>
						  The writing sample should be approximately 20 pages that you have written for a college level course or the equivalent in any subject. This may be an excerpt from something longer than 20 pages or a complete paper. It can be something that has been published, or not.</p>
							<p>15. <strong>How long should the Statement of Purpose be?</strong><br>
						  There is no minimum or maximum limit on the statement of purpose; the suggestion is that it should be 1 or at most 2 pages.</p>
							<p>16. <strong>If my degree objective is the Ph.D., shall I indicate PhD or M.A./Ph.D. on the application? </strong><br>
						  All applicants, including those who do not or will not have an M.A. degree by the time of entry, should indicate &quot;Ph.D.&quot; as their degree goal.</p>
							<p>17. <strong>Can I be admitted if I have deficiencies in preparation?</strong><br>
						  Applicants without the M.A. degree should have fulfilled the equivalent of the Departmental requirements for the B.A. degree. Minor deficiencies in preparation would need to be repaired during the student's first year of graduate work. For more extensive preparatory work, prospective applicants might consider enrolling in UC Extension’s Concurrent Enrollment Program, through which students may enroll in the regular courses for this Department. Units for courses taken through this program will not be credited toward the student's M.A. requirements. Registration and fee information is available through the <a href="http://www.unex.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">University Extension</a>, (510) 642-4111.</p>
							<p>18. <strong>Can I take NES courses without being admitted to the program?</strong><br>
							  With the instructor's approval, you can enroll in regular NES courses through UC Berkeley Extension’s Concurrent Enrollment program. Please note, however, that you will not be considered a UC Berkeley student, and you cannot accumulate credit toward a Berkeley degree without being formally admitted to a Berkeley program.</p>

			      <p><strong>TOEFL requirements:<br />
	              </strong>All applicants from countries in which the official language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), one of the English language proficiency tests. However, TOEFL can be waived for those students who have completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a U.S. university. 
			        Please note that TOEFL scores more than two years old at the time of application cannot be considered.<br>

Entering students may apply by filling  out the appropriate portion of the admission application. FLAS (Foreign  Language and Area Studies) fellowships and multi-year UC fellowships  are administered through the Graduate Division on the basis of a  campus-wide competition. The  department typically nominates admitted doctoral students of outstanding achievement  for competition-based university-wide fellowships. Competition for Magistretti fellowships, Block  Grant awards, and smaller stipends and nonresident tuition grants is  department-based.  Graduate applicants who are members of certain ethnic minority groups  may qualify for the University's Graduate Opportunity Program. Please  refer to the Graduate Division for details.  Applicants for any of these awards who are U.S. citizens or Residents  are asked to submit a <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a>.

                          <p>Information on courses currently offered by the Department may be obtained from the NES web site (http://nes.berkeley.edu/courses.html) or the Department Office, 250 Barrows Hall (510), 642-6162 or 642-3757.</p>
                          <p><strong>II.               GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
                          <p><strong>Advising</strong></p>
                          <p>Graduate students will be assisted by one of the Department's appointed Graduate Advisers, who will take general responsibility for counseling and planning of pro­grams.  For Fall 2015 and Spring 2016, Professor Niek Veldhuis will serve as Head Graduate Adviser. The student will also be aided by the Student Services Adviser (GSAO) Deanna Kiser-Go (dkisergo@berkeley.edu; 642-4915) in all administrative matters.  Students are urged to take courses and consult with as many as possible of the faculty of the Department with interests relevant to theirs. As soon as possible, ideally by the end of the first or second semester of graduate study, students should select a three-member faculty committee to guide their academic work. (See the sections about formation of a committee for students in the Ph.D. programs).</p>
                          <p><strong>Normative Time and Fees</strong></p>
                          <p>All students are subject to the Normative Time Policy of the University and are required:<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>(a)</strong> to register each semester in which they make use of University facilities and faculty time.</p>
                          <p><strong>(b</strong>) to satisfy all the requirements for the PhD. Degree, including filing of the dissertation, <em>within five years of entrance with an M.A. degree or within seven years of entrance with a B.A. degree. </em>An additional two semesters of &ldquo;withdrawal,&rdquo; i.e., of being non-registered (for medical or parental leave only), may be approved.</p>
                          <p>To comply with normative time, students are generally considered to be making satisfactory progress if they are advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. (i.e., having passed the PhD. qualifying examination, prepared a dissertation prospectus, and formed a dissertation committee) within four years of entry into the Department. This leaves three years, and possibly two semesters of approved withdrawal, for </p>
                          <p>the writing of the dissertation. Failure to make satisfactory progress will affect eligibility for financial assistance.</p>
                          <p>Students who have not completed the dissertation within the normative time requirements plus a two-year grace period are subject to being put on probationary status, the first step of which is the lapsing of the student's candidacy, followed by termination of candidacy. A student whose candidacy has lapsed may not hold any academic appointment (e.g. GSI or GSR). Steps necessary to regain candi­dacy status are increasingly rigorous as time passes. In extreme cases, a student may be required to retake qualifying examinations. For details, please refer to Graduate Division policies at: &lt;http://grad.berkeley.edu/policy&gt;. </p>
                          <p><strong>DCF Award</strong></p>
                          <p>After advancement to candidacy, students may apply for the Doctoral Completion Fellowship (DCF), which is a one-year award that carries a yearly stipend and pays fees. The DCF provides an incentive for students to file their dissertations within a reasonable time (within a year of the program&rsquo;s Normative Time to Degree). To be eligible for the DCF, the student must be advanced to candidacy; the DCF must be used by <em>Normative Time to Degree plus one year</em>; to activate the DCF, the student must have a satisfactory Academic Progress report on file—to be completed every year after advancement to candidacy—from most recent year after advancement &lt;<a href="https://gradlink.berkeley.edu/GLOW/">https://gradlink.berkeley.edu/GLOW/</a>&gt;. It is important to plan the activation of the DCF award accordingly, as after the DCF is used the students will no longer be eligible for any University support, including GSI and GSR appointments, after Normative Time to Degree plus one year.  </p>
                          <p><strong>Filing Fee </strong></p>
                          <p>The Filing Fee (http://grad.berkeley.edu/policy/registration-and-exchange-programs-policy/#d2-filing-fee) is a reduced fee for graduate students who have completed all requirements for the degree except for taking the final comprehensive examination for the master's degree, and securing the required signatures on the doctoral dissertation title page before filing the dissertation. The Filing Fee is not a form of, or equivalent to, registration. To use the Filing Fee in fall, the student must have been registered in the previous spring or summer (3 units minimum in summer). To use the Filing Fee in spring, the student must have been registered in the previous fall. The application must be signed by the head Graduate Adviser and submitted to the Graduate Division by the end of the first week ofclasses for the semester in which the student intends to file for the degree. Filing Fee status will not be reinstated or transferred because the dissertation or thesis was not filed, or the examination not taken or not passed. The Filing Fee is valid for the length of the semester for which Filing Fee status has been approved, up to the deadline for filing for a degree in that semester. The Filing Fee may be used only once.</p>
                          <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Registration/Study List</strong></p>
                          <p>Students must pay fees and enroll in courses before the deadlines published by the Office of the Registrar or they will be charged a substantial late fee. <em>It is the student's responsibility to be aware of, and meet, these deadlines. </em>Students enroll in courses for each fall semester during the preceding spring semester, and for each spring semester during the preceding fall. Each student&rsquo;s course schedule must be approved by a Graduate Adviser before the Adviser will give the student the <em>Adviser code, </em>needed for enrollment in courses. Enrollment rules, deadlines, and information are available at:  &lt;http://registrar.berkeley.edu/tbinfo.html&gt;. </p>
                          <p>All entering students are required to take the NES 200 Graduate Proseminar, a one credit hour course that surveys the various disciplines and subfields of Near Eastern Studies, in their first or second year. All students specializing in Egyptian and Ancient Near Eastern Studies must take NES 202, Fields, Methods and Current Trends in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Studies, which provides an introduction to the diversity of fields and disciplines that comprise ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Studies. </p>
                          <p>The Graduate Council considers 12 units of graduate coursework (units in the 200 series or, if appropriate, the 600 series) or 16 units in the 100 series a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; load for full-time students who are not advanced to candidacy. There are, however, cases in which higher or lower unit loads will be desirable on academic grounds or in light of individual circumstances (e.g., working students whose employment does not materially contribute to academic training and progress toward the degree). <br>
                            <br>
                            Please see the Berkeley Academic Guide online and the Graduate Division&rsquo;s web page for further information on normal coursework loads. All students, including fellowship holders and Graduate Student Instructors who are not advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., are required to carry at least 12 units of coursework. This requirement does not apply to GSIs and fellowship holders who are advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. All courses in which the student is enrolled will count in this total of 12 units, including special study courses, individual studies courses (601, 602), and courses on preparation for teaching (300-level). No more than 8 units of 600-level courses are allowed per semester. <strong></strong></p>
                          <p><strong>Grading</strong></p>
                          <p>Grades are awarded for courses at the discretion of the course instructor. Graduate students are required by University regulations to maintain a grade point average of at least 3.0 (&quot;B&quot;). Students who fail to meet this minimum standard, or who do not make normal progress in other respects toward the degree, may be subject to probation and eventual dismissal by the Dean of the Graduate Division. To be eligible to take Ph.D. qualifying examinations or to hold an academic appointment, the student may carry no more than two grades of &ldquo;I&rdquo; (Incomplete) on his or her record.</p>
                          <p>For Ph.D. students, no more than one-third of total units (including 100-level and 200-level courses and excluding courses numbered 299 and above) may be graded as S/U (satisfactory/unsatisfactory). For M.A. students, two-thirds of total units must be letter-graded (including 100-level and 200-level courses and excluding courses numbered below 100 or 299 and above). For more information on grade requirements refer to &lt; http://grad.berkeley.edu/policy/coursework-grading-probation-and-dismissal-policy/#e13-grades&gt;. </p>
                          <p><strong>Appeals</strong></p>
                          <p>The Department has an appeals process for matters of departmental decisions that would terminate or otherwise impede the progress of a student toward his or her academic degree goal (e.g., decisions to put a student on probationary status, dismiss student, terminate or lapse the candidacy of a student). Copies of this process are posted and are available from the Graduate Student Services Adviser, in room 250B Barrows.</p>
                          <p><strong>Graduate Division</strong></p>
                          <p>Many important regulations governing the M.A. and Ph.D. degree programs are issued by the Graduate Division. Much of this information is available on the web, and students are encouraged to refer to it: &lt; http://grad.berkeley.edu/policy/&gt;.</p>
                          <p><strong>III.              THE MASTER OF ARTS DEGREE</strong></p>
                          <p>If the student's undergraduate preparation is deficient, the student may be required to undertake coursework in addition to that which is normally required for the M.A. degree. In such cases, the additional coursework may cause the student to exceed the usual two years, which the Graduate Division considers &quot;satisfactory progress&quot; with respect to completion of the M.A. program.</p>
                          <p>The M.A. degree in Near Eastern Studies is obtained according to the Graduate Division's Plan II (with a comprehensive exam), not Plan I (with a thesis).</p>
                          <p>Specific requirements for the degree are listed below. Particular attention should be paid to the section concerning M.A. degree advancement to candidacy, which describes the relative timing of the various requirements.</p>
                          <p><strong>Academic Residence</strong></p>
                          <p>A minimum of two semesters of academic residence is required for the M.A. degree. A student must enroll in and complete a minimum of 4 units of upper division or graduate courses on the Berkeley campus in each of the required semesters. Only courses in the 100 or 200 series satisfy this requirement.</p>
                          <p><strong>Formation of an M.A. Committee</strong></p>
                          <p>As soon as the student's areas of interest become clear, but <em>certainly not later than the beginning of the third semester after admission, </em>the student should select a three-member faculty committee to guide his/her work toward the degree. The choice of the committee is the student's responsibility and must be approved by the faculty members involved and by the Graduate Adviser. With the help of the Graduate Adviser, therefore, students should seek, from the outset of their program, professors whose fields of specialization most nearly correspond to their own areas of interest. One, or possibly two, members of this committee may be members of a department other than Near Eastern Studies, but the chair of the committee must be a member of the faculty of this Department. </p>
                          <p>The Graduate Division recommends that members of the M.A. committee be regular members of the Berkeley faculty. Visiting faculty and lecturers who hold a Ph.D. degree may participate on M.A. examination committees with the permission of the Graduate Adviser. No visiting faculty member, however, may chair an examination. Except in the most unusual circumstances, no more than one visiting faculty member may serve on an examination committee.</p>
                          <p>Members of the M.A. committee will meet with the student to help determine the student's fields of study, and to suggest an appropriate program of study. The committee will also periodically review the student's progress.</p>
                          <p><strong>Third Semester Review</strong></p>
                          <p>Early inthe student's third semester of study, he or she is expected to meet with their three-member M.A. committee to review the student's progress toward the degree. In evaluating the student's performance, the committee will consider the student's grades and general academic progress. The student's specific research interests and goals will be discussed at the meeting. If a serious deficiency is discovered in the student's preparation, the committee will advise the student in writing as to ways of dealing with it.<strong></strong></p>
                          <p><strong>Modern European language</strong></p>
                          <p>All M.A. candidates are required to pass an examination in one modern European language before applying for M.A. candidacy. In this Department, the language required is normally French or German. Another modern language may be substituted for one of these if it is clearly necessary to the student's field of study. Any such substitution must be approved by the Graduate Adviser and the student's advisory committee.</p>
                          <p>The text of the European language examination is selected by the chair of the student's committee. At the beginning of the semester when the student intends to take the exam, the student should fill out the online examination scheduling form (provided by the Graduate Student Services Adviser) and inform his or her committee chair of the need to provide the Graduate Student Services Adviser with a selected exam passage. The student then schedules the exam with the Graduate Services Adviser. The completed exam is circulated to the student's committee, which is responsible for grading. The examination consists of one or two passages totaling at least 300 words. This passage must be translated into English in 90 minutes. Use of a dictionary is permitted. If a student does not pass the examination, the examination may be repeated, but not until the following semester.</p>
                          <p>Students must pass the modern European language examination or receive approval of the Adviser and Dean for a waiver of the examination <em>before </em>applying for candidacy for the M.A. degree. The examination is taken on a departmental computer. The students receive their completed examination copies (source text and translation) in the electronic format.</p>
                          <p><strong>Coursework</strong></p>
                          <p>All students are required to complete 24 units of coursework in 100 or 200 series courses. Two-thirds of all course work must be letter-graded. Twelve units should be taken in the 200 series in the major subject. The department&rsquo;s graduate proseminar, NES 200, must be taken by all students in their first or second year.<br>
                            <br>
                            For students in <em>language </em>programs: at least 24 semester units of coursework (see degree outlines), at least 12 of which must be in 200 series courses in the major, and three semesters of work in a Near Eastern language other than the student's major language. Knowledge of one modern Semitic language is recommended for students of ancient languages.</p>
                          <p>For students in <em>archaeology and art history </em>programs with a <em>Near Eastern </em>emphasis: at least 24 units of course work, at least 12 of which must be in 200 series courses; three semesters must be drawn from NES 223A,B.</p>
                          <p>For students in <em>archaeology and art history </em>programs with an <em>Egyptian </em>emphasis: at least 24 units of course work, at least 12 of which must be in 200 series courses. The required 24 units must include two semesters work in the ancient Egyptian language beyond second-year level. The 12 200 series units must be from seminar courses. (One 200 level Egyptian language course may count towards the seminar course requirement.)</p>
                          <p>Not more than one-third of the total units (excluding those in the 300 or 600 series) that the student has passed at Berkeley at the time the degree is awarded may be taken on a S/U basis. Students may earn no more than 8 units of 601 in a semester. <br>
                            <br>
                            M.A. students may not fulfill more than 8 of the required units by courses graded &quot;Satisfactory.&quot;</p>
                          <p><strong>Research Papers</strong></p>
                          <p>Two research papers, one of which must demonstrate bibliographic mastery of a given topic, must be placed on file in the departmental office <em>at least four weeks prior to the first M.A. examination. </em>These papers may be written in the context of coursework taken for the M.A., or may be written independently of coursework, under the supervision of a faculty member. Any paper submitted as an M.A. paper must be approved by the faculty member for whom it was written, as well as by the M. A. committee. Faculty members indicate their approval by signing the title page form provided to them by the student (and obtained from the Graduate Student Services Adviser).</p>
                          <p><strong>Advancement to Candidacy for the M.A. Degree</strong></p>
                          <p>Students must be advanced to candidacy prior to taking their comprehensive M.A. examinations. The department must submit to the Graduate Division the &ldquo;Application for Candidacy&rdquo; form, signed by the Department&rsquo;s Head Graduate Adviser, no later than the end of the fifth week of classes of the semester in which the student plans to take the M.A. examinations. Such a petition cannot be filed until one-half of the required coursework has been completed. The student's petition for candidacy must be filed after the student satisfies the European language exam requirement (see above) and before the student appears for the M.A. examination. </p>
                          <p><strong>M.A. Examinations</strong></p>
                          <p>The student must successfully complete written examinations covering one major and two minor fields. These are set and graded by the student's M.A. committee. For students in language programs, at least one of the examinations will include a translation of a text from the student's major language into English. Use of a dictionary (or other appropriate aids, where dictionaries as such are not available) may or may not be permitted. A question of bibliographical nature will also be included. <em>All examinations must be written in the English language. </em>For a list of possible fields of examination for the M.A. degree, see Appendix I. These examinations are not scheduled for the summer or inter-session, and only in special circumstances will they be scheduled for the first few weeks of a semester.</p>
                          <p><strong>M.A. Examinations in Detail:</strong></p>
                          <ol>
                            <li><strong>M.A. Examination focus, scope and preparation:</strong></li>
                          </ol>
                          <p>The focus and scope of each examination will be decided by members of the student's M.A. committee in consultation with the student. The student should confer with each member of the committee about required reading for the examinations. Copies of all reading lists supplied for the examination should be distributed to each member of the student's M.A. committee. The student who is studying for the examinations may receive up to 8 units of credit per semester by enrolling in NES 601, &quot;Individual Studies for Master's Students.&quot; These units cannot be applied toward fulfillment of the required 24 units of coursework. Further, these units do not count toward the establishment of academic residency.</p>
                          <ol>
                            <li><strong>M.A. Examination scheduling:</strong></li>
                          </ol>
                          <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>At the beginning of the semester when the student intends to take the exam, the student must fill out the online examination scheduling form (provided by the Graduate Student Services Adviser). Each member of his or her advisory committee indicates their willingness to serve on the examination committee by agreeing to the selected exam topics and dates. </p>
                          <p>All three examinations must be taken within the course of 7 days. Examination dates will be set by the Graduate Student Services staff in consultation with the student and the M.A. committee. The student may not take an M.A. examination unless he or she has been advanced to candidacy by the Graduate Division (see above). Students must allow time between the last written examination and the end of the semester for a Permission to Proceed examination, which enables them to move on to the Ph.D. program.</p>
                          <ol>
                            <li><strong>M.A. Exam evaluation:</strong></li>
                          </ol>
                          <p>The M.A. degree is awarded on the basis of the student's performance on the written examinations described above. The faculty committee will decide whether or not to recommend the degree within a week of the completion of the written examination.</p>
                          <p>At the discretion of the student's M.A. committee, a student may be awarded a &quot;superior&quot; pass in the M.A. examination. If the student fails the examination, the committee may recommend for or against a repeat examination. If part of the examination is unsatisfactory, the student may be asked to take all or part of the examination again, or may be asked to do additional work to meet the M.A. committee's criteria for a satisfactory examination. A third attempt is not permitted.</p>
                          <p><strong>Permission to Proceed Examination</strong></p>
                          <p><em>Within three weeks </em>after completing all of the M.A. degree requirements (including successful passage of the M.A. examinations), the student must take an oral Permission to Proceed examination, which must be taken by the last day of the semester. This examination is normally given by the student's M.A. advisory committee. It is scheduled by the Graduate Student Services staff in consultation with the student and the committee.</p>
                          <p>The student should meet with the Graduate Student Services Adviser early in the semester to schedule this examination. The purpose of the examination is to determine whether or not the student is ready to pursue research and study at the doctoral level, and is capable of completing such research and study in an acceptable period of time.</p>
                          <p><strong>IV.              PH.D. DEGREE</strong></p>
                          <p><strong>Evaluation of Students Admitted Directly to the Ph.D. Program</strong></p>
                          <p>Students who hold an M.A. or equivalent degree from another institution (or another UC department) may be admitted directly to the Ph.D. degree program upon their admission to the Department. Students in this category whose preparation is deemed inadequate in some subjects may be required to undertake appro­priate coursework. At the end of the first year of study, the records of such students will be examined by their advisory committee (principal faculty Adviser and two other faculty members with whom the student has taken coursework), and a decision will be made by that committee as to whether the student may remain in the Ph.D. program.</p>
                          <p><strong>Progress Reviews of Students Enrolled in the Ph.D. Program</strong></p>
                          <p>Each student's progress will be reviewed on a regular basis at annual meetings scheduled by the student with at least two members of the student's committee. Please see the section entitled &ldquo;Normative Time&rdquo; for the suggested rate of progress toward the Ph.D. degree.</p>
                          <p><strong>Pre-Candidacy Requirements</strong></p>
                          <p><strong>Academic Residence and Other Residence Requirements</strong></p>
                          <p>Academic Senate legislation requires a minimum of 4 semesters of academic residence for the Ph.D. degree. A student must enroll in and complete a minimum of 4 units of upper division or graduate courses in each of the required semesters. Only courses in the 100 or 200 series fulfill this requirement. Semesters spent in the Department for an M.A. program may be used to satisfy this requirement if those semesters are additional to the two required for the M.A. Thus, students who earn the M.A. and Ph.D. must register for a total of 6 semesters. </p>
                          <p>The student must be registered when taking the written preliminary and oral comprehensive qualifying examinations and during any other semester when faculty time and/or the use of University facilities is required.</p>
                          <p><strong>Ph.D. coursework</strong></p>
                          <p>After passing the Permission to Proceed examination at the M.A. level, or after being admitted directly into the Ph.D. program, the student is encouraged to meet as soon as possible with his/her Ph.D. examination committee (see below) to establish a program of coursework for the Ph.D. Although there are no specific required courses for the Ph.D. program, it is expected that a student will include, at a minimum, seminar work in at least two divisions of the Department. All graduate students are required to be enrolled in 12 units of classes in order to be considered registered full time. Not more than one third of the total units (excluding those in the 300 or 600 series) that the student has passed at Berkeley at the time the degree is awarded may be taken on a S/U basis. Students may earn no more than 8 units of 602 in a semester.</p>
                          <p><strong>Ph.D. Examination Committee</strong></p>
                          <p>The student, in consultation with his or her departmental Graduate Adviser, must select a four-member faculty committee to guide him or her in preparation for the written preliminary and oral comprehensive qualifying examinations. One member of this committee must be a member of the Berkeley Academic Senate from outside the Department of Near Eastern Studies.</p>
                          <p>The chair of the examination committee may not direct the dissertation, and must be a faculty member of the Department of Near Eastern Studies. As soon as possible after admission, the student should try, with the committee's assistance, to define one major and two minor fields of study (fields on which the student will be examined during both the written preliminary and oral qualifying examination) and to plan coursework and language study with these examination fields in mind.</p>
                          <p><strong>Near Eastern Languages for Archaeology/Art History Students</strong></p>
                          <p>Egyptian Archaeology and Art History majors must pass a proficiency exam in Egyptian and/or Coptic <em>before </em>the written preliminary examinations are taken. Near Eastern Archaeology/Art History students must complete a minimum of two years course work in an ancient Near Eastern language or must pass a proficiency examination in an ancient Near Eastern language before taking the preliminary examinations. The language proficiency examinations will be three hours in duration and will test for competence in texts selected for their relevance to the student's program. When requested, the language proficiency examinations will be arranged by the Graduate Services staff in consultation with the student and the examiners. Prior to registering for courses in the first semester of Ph.D. coursework, the student should consult with the relevant Graduate Adviser as to what language might be appropriate for his/her program of study.</p>
                          <p><strong>Modern European Languages</strong></p>
                          <p>All Ph.D. students must have passed reading examinations in two modern European languages before proceeding to the preliminary examinations. The modern language examinations will follow the form prescribed under the M.A. requirements (see above). Students who have passed through an M.A. program of this department will already have satisfied the requirement in at least one language. Credit is not given for language examinations taken at other schools. </p>
                          <p><strong>Fieldwork for Students in Egyptian and Near Eastern Archaeology/Art History</strong></p>
                          <p>Each student specializing in Egyptian or Near Eastern Archaeology/Art History must acquire practical experience in archaeology or museum studies. The student should confer with his or her examination committee on ways of gaining this experience, which may include participation in excavations, study in approved museums, or other activities related to fieldwork and approved by the examination committee.</p>
                          <p><strong>Ph.D. Examinations</strong></p>
                          <p>The Department requires that its doctoral students pass comprehensive writ­ten preliminary examinations before proceeding to the comprehensive oral quali­fying examination. Students are eligible to take the written examinations after completing all of the requirements for the Ph.D. outlined above. <em>Early in the semester </em>in which the examinations are to occur, the student must discuss the scheduling of these exams with the Graduate Student Services Adviser, who will file the required application for the student's admission to the qualifying examination with the Graduate Division (see below about the timeline of the application). At the beginning of the semester when the student intends to take the exam, the student must fill out the online examination scheduling form and must obtain the approval of all four examination committee members, indicating their willingness to conduct his/her comprehensive written preliminary examinations and the comprehensive oral qualifying examination. </p>
                          <p>The Graduate student Services staff will schedule the examinations in consultation with the student, based on the availability of one&rsquo;s exam committee members. These examinations are not scheduled for the summer or intersession, and only in special circumstances will they be scheduled for the first few weeks of a semester. According to the Graduate Division regulations, the faculty member who chairs the student's preliminary and qualifying examination committee may not chair the student's dissertation committee.</p>
                          <p>Applications for admission to the qualifying examination must be filed with the Graduate Division by the Department no later than three weeks prior to the proposed date of the examination. This application will specify the three fields of study to be covered during the examination.</p>
                          <p><strong>Written Preliminary Examinations</strong></p>
                          <p>Students must complete one written comprehensive examination for each subject area specified in the application to be covered during the comprehensive oral qualifying examination. Three comprehensive written examinations are required, therefore, to cover the student's major subject area and two minor areas. All of these examinations must be completed in a 7-day period. <em>Students wishing to take comprehensive preliminary and qualifying examinations must inform (by filling out the electronic form) the Graduate Student Services Adviser early in the semester in which these examinations are to be taken. The examinations will be scheduled upon consultation with the student and examiners. </em>The comprehensive preliminary examinations may be of any written form determined by the examiners, but it is suggested that they should consist of a choice of not more than three from a wide range of essay questions. Students should consult with their committee members well in advance concerning the form, which each examination will take.</p>
                          <p>For all students in the department, except those in Archaeology/Art History specializations, the comprehensive written preliminary examinations will include examinations in at least two Near Eastern languages. The Near Eastern language requirements in the Archaeology/Art History programs are described in the section (above) of &quot;Near Eastern Languages for Archaeology/Art history Students.&quot;</p>
                          <p>Any student who fails a written examination in one or more subject area(s) twice may be referred to the Dean of the Graduate Division for dismissal from the Ph.D. program.</p>
                          <p><strong>Qualifying Examination</strong></p>
                          <p>The qualifying examination is a comprehensive oral examination conducted by the four faculty members of the student's Ph.D. examination committee, one of whom must be a Berkeley Academic Senate member from outside the Department of Near Eastern Studies. The examination is designed to reveal the breadth and depth of the student's knowledge, as well as his or her sophistication of reasoning. It is therefore not to be concerned narrowly, nor to be concerned solely with a dissertation prospectus. Based on the student's performance, the faculty will determine whether the candidate is ready to enter the research phase of Ph.D. study. A report on the student's examination performance, signed by all four examiners, is submitted to the Graduate Division. Application for the Qualifying Examination form is available at: <br>
  &lt;http://grad.berkeley.edu/academic-progress/forms/&gt;.<br>
  <br>
                            Students are eligible to take the comprehensive oral qualifying examination after passing the written preliminary examinations. The oral examination should take place within 10 business days of the last written preliminary examination and before the end of the semester. If the student fails the qualifying examination, the committee may recommend for or against a repeat examination. A third examination is not permitted.</p>
                          <p><strong>Advancement to Candidacy to Ph.D.</strong></p>
                          <p>After the student passes the qualifying examination, they must apply for advancement to candidacy: http://grad.berkeley.edu/academic-progress/forms/.</p>
                          <p>Before filing this application, the student must first obtain approval of a dissertation prospectus on an appropriate topic from his/her proposed dissertation committee. The prospectus should include a detailed outline, a short essay-type description of the dissertation, and a bibliography. It is important that the student follows the Graduate Division&rsquo;s application procedures and deadlines. For more information see: http://grad.berkeley.edu/policy/degrees-policy/#f28-advancement-to-candidacy-for-a-doctoral-degree.  </p>
                          <p>Following consultation with the student, the Faculty Graduate Adviser may recommend a dissertation committee of three members. This committee is to be chaired by the departmental Academic Senate member most directly concerned with the student's research. This cannot be the same person who chaired the student's qualifying examination committee. If the student's research is such that different aspects of it are the chief concerns of different members of the committee, and no single member directs the whole, then joint chairs may be appointed. One member of the committee must be a Berkeley Academic Senate member from a department other than Near Eastern Studies. The names of the faculty proposed for the dissertation committee and a tentative dissertation title are submitted to the Graduate Division on the Application for Candidacy form. The Graduate Division charges a fee of $90.00, which must be paid when the application for candidacy is filed. When the application is approved by the Graduate Dean, the student becomes a candidate for the Ph.D. degree.</p>
                          <p><strong>Candidate in Philosophy Degree</strong></p>
                          <p>The C.Phil. degree, which gives formal recognition to a definite state of progress toward the doctorate, may be awarded after the student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Typically, a student who is advanced to candidacy in the fall semester will be on the C.Phil. degree list the following May, and those advanced in the spring semester will be on the degree list the following December. </p>
                          <p><strong>Academic Progress Report</strong></p>
                          <p>Doctoral students who have advanced to Candidacy are required to complete the online form of Academic Progress Report &lt;https://gradlink.berkeley.edu/GLOW/&gt; each year until they complete the program.</p>
                          <p><strong>Dissertation</strong></p>
                          <p>Specific University requirements for dissertation format, filing, and deadlines are found in the &quot;Dissertation Writing and Filing,&quot; section of the Graduate Division&rsquo;s website: &lt;http://grad.berkeley.edu/academic-progress/dissertation/&gt;. <br>
                            <br>
                            The completed dissertation must be signed by all members of the dissertation committee. A final examination for the Ph.D. degree may be required by the dissertation committee. It is the student's responsibility to maintain contact with all members of the committee and to arrange for each member to have enough time to review each stage of the dissertation. Students must be registered when drafts of their dissertations are being read by faculty members. Students who meet the stipulations for use of the Filing Fee may petition to pay the Filing Fee <em>in lieu of</em> registration fees for the semester in which the dissertation is filed. Filing Fee status is <em>not</em> a form of registration and student services are reduced accordingly. Refer to this page for the dissertation filing deadlines: &lt;http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/policies/degree_filing_deadlines.shtm&gt;.</p>
                          <p><strong>Dissertation Colloquium for Ph.D. Candidates in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Programs</strong><br>
                            <br>
                            All Ph.D. students in the Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern programs are required to give an oral presentation (approximately 45 minutes) on their dissertation. The candidate should consult with his or her dissertation Advisers to determine the scope of the presentation. The colloquium should be scheduled during the advanced stages of the dissertation and must be attended by the candidate&rsquo;s dissertation inside committee members. It is expected that all graduate students and faculty in ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern studies will attend dissertation colloquia. </p>

                          <p>For the upcoming academic year awards for continuing students, the application deadline is in late January for FLAS (Foreign Language and Area Studies) Awards and will probably be early January for the above-mentioned awards:<br>
  &lt;http://grad.berkeley.edu/financial/fellowships/&gt;.</p>
                          <p>For information on the Doctoral Completion Fellowship (DCF), which is offered to students in the Ph.D. program who are making good progress and who are advanced to candidacy, see the Graduate Division's web page at: &lt;http://grad.berkeley.edu/financial/fellowships/&gt;.<br>
                            <br>
                            The Graduate Division also awards a highly competitive one-year fellowship, the Dissertation Year Fellowship (DYF), for students completing the dissertation. Each spring faculty are invited to nominate students for this award. Multi-year UC fellowships (most of which are available for incoming students only) and FLAS fellowships are administered through the Graduate Division on the basis of a campus-wide competition. &lt;http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/fellowships-entering/&gt;.<br>
  <br>
                          Competition for smaller stipends and for nonresident tuition waivers is department based. Continuing students apply for FLAS Awards through TANGO at &lt;https://tango.berkeley.edu/applicant/app/start&gt;. Students obtain applications for all other awards at the Department office, 250 Barrows Hall, and review of these applications will begin immediately after the application deadline. All parts of the application, including transcripts and letters of recommendation, must be received by the appropriate office by that time. In order to be eligible for many of these funds, students must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), available at the Graduate Division (www.grad.berkeley.edu/financial/aid/) or at &lt;http://www.fafsa.ed.gov&gt;. </p>
                          <p>FLAS fellowships are available to students studying modern Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, or Turkish. These awards are made to students who are: (a) U.S. citizens or nationals, or have permanent resident status.<br>
                            (b) are in advanced training in a foreign language or area studies, or are involved in research and training in the international aspects of professional and other fields of study. These fellowships pay registration fees and a stipend, plus nonresident tuition, if required. </p>
                          <p>University policies for graduate students allow most U.S. citizens and U.S. residents to establish California residency for tuition purposes after demonstrating residence in California and financial independence for one year preceding the request for resident status.</p>
                          <p><strong>Graduate Diversity Program</strong></p>
                          <p>It is the purpose of this Graduate Division program to support underrepresented students who are U.S. citizens or U.S. residents. Awards are made for one year only to Master's students and for two years to doctoral students. The University has identified African Americans, Chicanos/Latinos, Native American Indians, and Filipinos as the most severely underrepresented, and it recognizes that Asian Americans are underrepresented in certain fields. Applicants are urged to read carefully the materials in the Graduate Division application materials concerning this program. To receive a merit-based GDP fellowship, a student must have demonstrated outstanding scholarly achievement.</p>
                          <p><strong>Financial Aid Office</strong></p>
                          <p>Students may apply for several types of non-fellowship aid through the University Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships via Cal Student Central in 120 Sproul Hall.

                          Gil is a Ph.D. student in the Cuneiform Studies program. He received a B.A and an M.A. in Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Cultures from Tel Aviv University, Israel. He also received a B.A. in East Asian Studies from the same institution. Focusing his studies mostly on the languages of the Ancient Near East, he nonetheless participated in numerous archaeological excavations all over Israel, directing several of them. He is primarily interested in Babylonian astronomy and the intersection between the practice of astronomy and its place in society.

                            I study the languages, historiography, and epistemology of science and  technology in Assyrian and Babylonian scholarship. My research focuses  on technical and medical procedural recipes from the ancient Middle  East, composed in Akkadian on cuneiform tablets during the late second  and first millennia BCE. My dissertation ("Technology as Knowledge: A  Study of Cuneiform Procedural Recipes and Materials") seeks to  understand the nature of procedural recipe knowledge, and, in addition,  to employ digital tools for the disambiguation of rare technical terms.  To this end, I have incorporated network analysis tools into my  dissertation in order to produce semantic networks of technical  ingredients in context: <a href="http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/blog/15/11/24/dh-fellow-eduardo-escobar-analyzing-social-networks-and-semantic-networks-assyriology" target="_blank">http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/blog/15/11/24/dh-fellow-eduardo-escobar-analyzing-social-networks-and-semantic-networks-assyriology</a>.

 Muhammad U. Faruque is a PhD student specializing in Islamic thought, philosophy, and Persian (mystical) literature. His research focuses on Graeco-Arabica, Islamic philosophy and theology (especially, post-classical philosophy), and philosophical Sufism. Muhammad received his B.Sc. in Economics from the University of London in 2011. After his graduation, motivated by an increasing awareness at that time of the absolutely essential nature of learning primary languages well enough to deal with classical Islamic texts, he travelled to Iran to explore the Islamic intellectual tradition in depth. He managed to learn Persian in six months and merited entrance to the M.A. program in Islamic philosophy at Tehran University (the entire MA program is taught in Persian, based on reading original Arabic texts) where he completed his dissertation (Jun 2014) on Mullā Ṣadrā&rsquo;s and Dāwūd Qayṣarī&rsquo;s metaphysics, with particular emphasis on their treatment of the &ldquo;absolutely unconditioned being.&rdquo; He has also authored and co-authored a number of articles in Persian and English, including one on the primacy of the self (<em>atman</em>) in Advaita Vedanta and light (<em>al-nūr, </em>as principle of consciousness) in Suhrawardī (d. 1191) and the school of Illumination. He is also the recipient of a number of awards including the prestigious The Berkeley Fellowship for Graduate Study.

 Jenna's work focuses on the Hebrew Bible, and particularly Pentateuchal traditions. Her approach combines multiple methods including critical theory, anthropology, and sociology, with a firm grounding in the Bible's historical ancient Near Eastern context and attention to issues of textual production. The questions she asks are primarily focused on issues of cultural memory, historiography, and the history of ideas in ancient Israel and Judah. Because the way that communities tell stories and compose their history reflects beliefs about who they are, examining traditions that are represented in multiple texts throughout various times and locations is fruitful ground for understanding how ancient Israelites and Judeans understood themselves and their world. <br>

    <h3>About Graduate Programs in Near Eastern Studies</h3>
							<p>Graduate programs leading to the Ph.D. degree are   offered in  Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian languages and literatures, Near Eastern    Archaeology, Art History, Cuneiform, Hebrew Bible, Biblical and Judaic  Studies,   Egyptology, and Islamic Studies. </p>
                            <p>The length of time needed to complete the Ph.D. in the    Department depends on financial considerations, the extent of the  student's   earlier preparation, and similar factors. Students without  the M.A. degree are urged to complete the   M.A. requirements in two  years and are urged to   complete the Ph.D. degree requirements in an  additional five years. Degree requirements   should be completed  according to the University's "normative time" standards.
                              Students completing the M.A. degree requirements in this  Department need to pass   a Permission to Proceed exam after completing  the M.A. requirements. Applicants without the M.A. degree should have fulfilled the equivalent of the <a href="BA-degree-requirements.html">Departmental   requirements for the B.A. degree</a>. Minor deficiencies in preparation would   need to be repaired in the student's first year of graduate work. </p>
                          <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/eg-alexandria.jpg" alt="Alexandria, courtesy to C. Redmount" border="0" /></a>
                            <p><strong>                            Satisfying Requirements <u>After</u> being admitted to the Graduate Program:</strong></p>
                          <p><strong><em>Students without the M.A. Degree: </em></strong><br>
                            Once the student has been admitted in the Program, the M.A.  degree requirements should be satisfied according to <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/policy/degrees-policy/" target="_blank">Plan II</a>. In addition   to the requirements outlined, the student must pass a  reading examination in   French or German. (If it is clearly necessary  to the student's field of study,   another modern language may be  substituted on approval of the graduate adviser   and the student's  advisory committee).</p>

                          <p><strong><em>Plan II requirements for students in language   programs</em></strong><em>:</em> (1) at least 24 units of course work, at least 12 of which   must be in  200-series courses in the major and (possibly overlapping) three    semesters of work in a Near Eastern language other than the student's  major   language; (2) two scholarly papers written independently or in  connection with   course work; (3) written M.A. examinations to test (a)  working knowledge of the   pertinent languages, (b) general knowledge  of the history and civilizations of   the area of emphasis, and (c)  knowledge of and familiarity with other subjects   suggested by the  student's degree   committee.<br>
                            </p>
                            <p><strong><em>Plan II requirements for   students in archaeology and art history programs with a Mesopotamian   emphasis</em></strong><em>:</em> (1) at least 24 units of course work, at least 12 of which   must be in  200-series courses. Three semesters must be drawn from NES C220 and NES  223; (2) two scholarly papers written independently or in connection    with course work; (3) written M.A. examinations covering one major and  two minor   fields. <br>
                            </p>
                            <strong><em>Plan II   requirements for students in archaeology and art history programs with an   Egyptian emphasis</em></strong><em>:  </em>(1) at least 24 units of course work at least 12 of   which must be in  200-series courses. The required 24 units must include two   semesters  work in the ancient Egyptian language beyond second year level. The 12    200-series units must be from seminar courses (one 200-level Egyptian  language   course may count towards the seminar course requirement.);  (2) two scholarly   papers written independently or in connection with  course work; (3) written M.A.   examinations covering one major and two  minor   fields.<br>

						  <p><strong>Students with the M.A. Degree:</strong><br>
  Except for the Graduate Division's academic  residence   requirement, there are no specific unit requirements   for  the Ph.D. in this Department. Students select courses that will prepare  them   to meet the requirements for admission to candidacy. It is  expected that   students will take seminars in at least two areas in the  Department before   taking preliminary examinations. </p>
<p>Admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree depends on   successful completion of the following requirements: <br>
  (1) Ph.D. coursework;   (2) reading examinations in  French and German (proficiency in another language   to the student's  field of emphasis may be substituted for either French or   German on  approval of the graduate adviser and the student's advisory    committee); (3) proficiency in one or two Near Eastern languages as  required for   the student's field of study. (For language majors,  proficiency will be tested   by a comprehensive exam, which must be  taken and passed no later than the   semester prior to the student's  written preliminary examination, and the written   preliminary  examination, which will cover at least two Near Eastern languages.   For  Egyptian Archaeology and Art History majors, proficiency will be tested    through the written preliminary examinations, which will include an  examination   in Egyptian and/or Coptic. Archaeology/art history  students (except those in   Egyptian archaeology) who have not completed  a minimum of two years course work   in an ancient or modern Near  Eastern language must pass a proficiency   examination in an ancient or  modern Near Eastern Language before taking the   preliminary  examinations.); (4) field work (for art history and archaeology    majors); (5) written preliminary examinations and the oral qualifying    examination; (6) a prospectus of the dissertation approved by the  student's   proposed Ph.D. dissertation committee. After admission to candidacy, the student must fulfill the   requirements for the dissertation as outlined in the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/academic-progress/dissertation/">Graduate Division's Guidelines.</p>

          <h3><br>
            <u>Honors Program</u></h3>
          <p>With the consent of the student&rsquo;s major faculty adviser, a student in any of the Near Eastern Studies majors, who holds an overall GPA of 3.3 or higher in all coursework taken at the University, and a GPA of 3.51 or higher in courses completed in the major, may apply for admission to the honors program. The honors program provides students with an opportunity to research and write a thesis in the area of their major specialization. Successful completion of a thesis rewards a student to graduate with a distinction of honors in the major. <br>
            Students must maintain the required GPA in the major in order to remain eligible for the honors program. Students should begin the Honors Application process the semester before their senior year and receive the approval of two faculty members to serve on their Thesis Committee. The Thesis Committee should consist of a Near Eastern Studies faculty member to serve as the Thesis Supervisor and a second member of the NES Faculty who will agree to read and evaluate the thesis. <br>
            <strong>Timeline for the NES Honors application process</strong>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Submit a 1-page thesis proposal and a completed NES Honors Thesis Application Form in the first semester of the student&rsquo;s senior year. The Thesis Supervisor and the Undergraduate Faculty Major Adviser must approve the proposal and application. Please contact the NES <a href="http://nes.berkeley.edu/staff.html">Undergraduate Assistant</a> to obtain the NES Honors Thesis Application. </li>
            <li>If the proposal is approved, the student will need to enroll in <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/near-eastern-languages-literatures/#coursestext">NES 199 (Independent Study)</a> in the fall semester of their senior year in order to receive credit for research and writing of the thesis. The application for NES 199 is available with the Undergraduate Assistant. The Thesis Supervisor will serve as the approving faculty for the Independent Study. </li>
            <li>With the consent of the Thesis Supervisor, the student will then enroll in the Senior Honors course <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/near-eastern-civilizations/#coursestext" title="NE STUD H195">(NE&nbsp;STUD&nbsp;H195)</a> in the spring semester of their senior year.  </li>
            <li>The honors thesis must be no less than 20 double-spaced, typewritten pages (not including bibliography and supplemental materials).</li>
            <li>A draft of the honors thesis will be read and evaluated by the student&rsquo;s Thesis Committee no later than Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which NE STUD H195 is taken. </li>
            <li>The final honors thesis must be read and evaluated by the Thesis Committee members by Monday of the 15th week and deemed to be at least B+ quality in order to qualify the candidate for graduation with a degree of honors. The assignment of degree distinctions of &ldquo;high honor&rdquo; and &ldquo;highest honors&rdquo; is at the discretion of the Thesis Committee.   </li>
