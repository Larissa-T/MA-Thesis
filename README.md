# MA-Thesis
This repository holds all code and corpus for my MA thesis "Elitism in University web text" (working title)
With the use of readability formulas, it explores the complexity of program and course description of the top 100 humanities departments. 
The code is written in Python 3 (switched halfway through might need some extra formatting to get the transition from Python 2.7 to Python 3)
The link-crawler is based on buckyroberts spider which can be found here: https://github.com/buckyroberts/Spider 

I will provide documentation as the project develops
This project should see completion in June 2018
